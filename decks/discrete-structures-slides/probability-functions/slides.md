# Mathematical Sets in Python Programs

<v-clicks>

-   Set theory is useful in mathematics and computer science

-   The `Sympy` package gives an implementation of finite sets

    -   Remember, sets are "containers" for other elements

    -   The sets in Sympy are finite sets, called `FiniteSet`

    -   These sets have the same properties as built-in sets

    -   `FiniteSet` has a few features not provided by `set`

    -   A probability is the likelihood that an event will occur

    -   We can use either `set` or `FiniteSet` to study probabilities

-   Investigate probability after exploring an alternative approach to sets

# Using Python to Create a Finite Set

```python
empty_set = FiniteSet()
print(empty_set)

finite_set = FiniteSet(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
print(finite_set)
```

<v-clicks>

- Only works in you have installed and imported `sympy` !

- What is the output of this `print` statements in this program?

- Are there other ways to create a `FiniteSet` ?

- What operations can we perform with a `FiniteSet` ?

</v-clicks>

# Creating a Set from a List or Tuple

```python
list = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
finite_set = FiniteSet(*list)
print(finite_set)

tuple = (2, 4, 6, 8, 10)
finite_set = FiniteSet(*tuple)
print(finite_set)
```

<v-clicks>

- All approaches call the `FiniteSet` constructor

- Can construct a `FiniteSet` out of a list or a tuple

- What is the purpose of the `*` in this program?

</v-clicks>

# Output of Finite Set Creation Program

```python
# Explicit FiniteSet:
FiniteSet(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# Empty FiniteSet:
EmptySet

# FiniteSet from Tuple:
FiniteSet(2, 4, 6, 8, 10)

# FiniteSet Containing Tuple:
FiniteSet((2, 4, 6, 8, 10))
```

# Math and Programming Differences

<v-clicks>

-   Programmers **cannot** use sets like mathematicians do!

-   Python programs **cannot** store an infinite set

-   Finite sets must **fit** into a computer's **finite** memory

-   Programs need a **procedure** for **constructing** the set

-   Different programming languages and packages have other restrictions. For
instance, recall that Python programs **cannot** create sets that **contain
mutable elements** like lists! Why do you think that this is the case?

-   So, what are the **benefits** of using sets in Python programs?

-   Importantly, sets come with some **super-useful** default operations!

-   Thankfully, `sympy` contains even more basic operations! üëç

# Using Finite Sets in Sympy

```python
from sympy import FiniteSet

list = [1, 2, 3, 2]
finite_set = FiniteSet(*list)
print(finite_set)

for element in finite_set:
    print(element)
```

<v-clicks>

- What is the output of `print(finite_set)` ?

- What is the output of `print(element)` in the `for` loop?

- How do these two output segments differ?

# Subset Relationships with Finite Sets

```python
one = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
two = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)

subset = one.is_proper_subset(two)
print(subset)
subset = two.is_proper_subset(one)
print(subset)
```

<v-clicks>

- What is the mathematical definition of a **proper subset**?

- What is the purpose of the `is_proper_subset` function?

- What is the output of the `print(subset)` function calls?

</v-clicks>

---

# Subsets with Finite Sets ‚ôª

```python
one = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
three = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3, 4)

subset = one.is_proper_subset(three)
print(subset)
subset = three.is_proper_subset(one)
print(subset)
```

<v-clicks>

- Is `one` a proper subset of `three` ?

- Is `three` a proper subset of `one` ?

- What is the output of the `print(subset)` ?

</v-clicks>

---

# Program Output for Subset in Sympy

```python
# Set one proper subset set two:
False

# Set two proper subset set one:
False

# Set one proper subset set three:
True

# Set three proper subset set one:
False
```

---

# Union and Intersection with Finite Sets

```python
one = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
two = FiniteSet(1, 2, 3, 4)

union = one.union(two)
print(union)

intersection = one.intersection(two)
print(intersection)
```

<v-clicks>

- What is the meaning of `one.union(two)` ?

- What is the meaning of `one.intersection(two)` ?


</v-clicks>

# Output of a Set Intersection Program

```python
# Union:
FiniteSet(1, 2, 3, 4)

# Intersection:
FiniteSet(1, 2, 3)
```

<v-clicks>

- Would `set` produce the same output?

- Any questions about operations with `FiniteSet` ?

- A **probability** is the likelihood of an event's occurrence

- How can we use `FiniteSet` s for probability?

# Set Theory for Probability

<v-clicks>

-   Often it is difficult to calculate the probability of an event!

-   Sets help us reason about the basic concepts of probability

-   Fundamental definitions in the context of probability:

    -   **Experiment**: the check that we want to perform and understand
    -   **Sample Space**: all possible outputs of the chosen experiment
    -   **Event**: the set of outcomes for which we calculate a
        probability
    -   **Probability**: the likelihood that a specified event will
        occur
    -   **Uniform Distribution**: all outcomes are equally likely to
        occur

-   The **probability** of an event $E$ is $P(E) = |E| / |S| \in [0,1]$

-   The notation $|E|$ denotes the cardinality of the event set

-   For all events $E$ a greater $P(E)$ means that $E$ is more likely
