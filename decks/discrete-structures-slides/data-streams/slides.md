# Dynamically Generated Streams

<v-clicks>

-   **Sequences** and **streams** are evident in Python programs!

-   **Static**: does not change and **dynamic**: does change

-   **Static** sequences and **dynamically** **generated** **streams**:

    -   A list is a static sequence that exists as a complete data
        structure

    -   An file input stream appears dynamically over time when read

    -   Let's distinguish between static sequences and dynamic streams

    -   Example: streams are generated by iterators and range objects

-   What are the **benefits** of having a dynamic stream whose values are not
known until they are generated and returned? How does a discrete structure
influence the **memory consumption** of a Python program?

</v-clicks>

# File Input Involves the Use of Streams

```python
file = open("emails")
for line in file:
  name, email = line.split(",")
  if name == "John Davis":
    print(email)
```

<v-click>

- The **file** is a **sequence** of characters

- A **character** is a sequence of **numbers**

- Does the entire **file exist** in the computer's memory?

- What would happen if the file was **many gigabytes** in size?

- Are there **alternatives** for static sequences? What are they?

</v-click>

# Using Comprehensions and Generators

```python
list_comprehension =
  ['Hello' for i in range(3)]

generator_expression =
  ('Hello' for i in range(3))

print(list_comprehension)
print(generator_expression)
```

<v-click>

- How are these two constructs **similar** and **different**?

- What is the **output** of this Python program segment?

- How is this **different** than a **static sequence** like a file?

</v-click>

---

# Program Segment Output

```
Output from the list comprehension:

  ['Hello', 'Hello', 'Hello']

Output from the generator expression:

  <generator object <genexpr>
    at 0x7f0ebc7bc890>
```

<div class="mt-10">

<v-click>

- Okay, the first output makes sense! It iteratively created a list! âœ¨

- What is the meaning of `genexpr` and `0x7f0ebc7bc890` ?

</v-click>

</div>

# Using a Generator Expression in Python

```python
even_squares =
  (x * x for x in range(10)
             if x % 2 == 0)

print(even_squares)

for value in even_squares:
    print(value)
```

<v-click>

- How would you write this program with a list and loop(s)?

- What is the difference between the output statements?

</v-click>

---

# Output from a Generator Expression

```python
<generator object <genexpr>
  at 0x7f8cb00db430>

  0
  4
  16
  36
  64
```

<v-click>

- What is the meaning of `genexpr` and `0x7f8cb00db430` ?

- What does this tell us about generator expressions?

- What are the overall benefits of generators?

</v-click>

---

# Exhausting a Generator Expression

```python
even_squares =
  (x * x for x in range(10)
             if x % 2 == 0)

for value in even_squares:
    print(value)

for value in even_squares:
    print(value)
```

<v-click>

- The first `for` loop correctly iterates through the generator!

- What happens when the second `for` loop runs? No output! Why?

</v-click>

# Using Generator Functions in Python

```python {all|1|2-3|4-6|8|10-11|all}
def fibonacci_generator(n):
    a = 1
    b = 1
    for i in range(n):
        yield a
        a, b = b, a + b

print(fibonacci_generator)

for value in fibonacci_generator(10):
    print(fibonacci_value, end=" ")
```

---

# Output from a Generator Function

```
print(fibonacci_generator) produces:

    <function fibonacci_generator
      at 0x7f791d4bb1f0>

for value in fibonacci_generator(10):
    print(fibonacci_value, end=" ")

    1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55
```

<v-click>

- **Generator functions** versus **generator expressions**?

- Can you find the **pattern** in these numbers?

# Applying Monoids in Python Programs

<v-clicks>

-   Monoids are frequently used in Python programs

-   Python programs can use higher-order sequence functions

-   Using **monoids** and **higher-order** sequence functions:

    -   **Q1**: What is the difference between a list and a tuple?
    -   **Q2**: How does a monoid generalize strings and integers?
    -   **Q3**: How do higher-order sequence functions use monoids?
    -   **Q4**: How can map-filter-reduce support parallel programming?
    -   **Q5**: What type of speedup will a parallel program achieve?

-   What are the ways in which the mathematical concept of a monoid connects to
a wide variety of **practical applications** in the area of **parallel computing**?

-   How does the concept of a **monoid** create an **archetype** in our minds?
