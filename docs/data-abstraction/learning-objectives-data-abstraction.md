## Data Structures

A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following skills in data structures:

### Algorithm Engineering

- Correctly implement a data structure, such as a stack, list, or dictionary,
  ensuring that it provides all of the functionality required by the structure's
  specification.
- After importing an existing implementation of a data structure (e.g., a list
  or a dictionary), confirm that it provides the required functionality and
  integrate it into an existing program.
- Adapt an existing implementation of a data structure so that it offers
  additional and/or different functionality not provided by that structure's
  standard implementation.
- Leveraging knowledge of existing data structures like a list or dictionary:
    - Specify the input, output, and behavior of functions for a new data
      structure.
    - Design, implement, and document all functions of a new data structure.
    - Implement, execute, and maintain a test suite for a new data structure and
      demonstrate that, for particular input, its behavior matches the
      specification.
    - Integrate the new data structure with the data structures used by an
      existing program.
    - Document the trade-offs associated with the implementation of the new data
      structure, comparing and contrasting it with existing alternatives and
      justifying the need for the bespoke implementation instead of those that
      are already available.
- Use the principles of object-oriented programming (i.e., encapsulation,
  inheritance, and polymorphism) to design, implement, document, and test
  classes that provide all of the features required by the specification of a
  data structure and the algorithms that process it.
- Use exception handling techniques to ensure that the implementation of a data
  structure does not inappropriately crash when it runs in non-standard
  execution circumstances.
- Given input from the file system, network, or console, input the data values,
  store them in a data structure like a list, and then implement and use a
  sorting algorithm like merge sort to order the list of values. Using the same
  list of values, implement and use a search algorithm that can either find a
  specific value in the list or confirm that the value is not in the list.
- Given a finite input and solution constraints, use a dynamic programming
  technique to efficiently solve an instance of an optimization problem (e.g.,
  the 0/1 Knapsack Problem).

### Algorithm Evaluation

- Given the psuedo-code description of an algorithm that processes and/or
  manipulates a data structure, perform the following steps as part of its
  analytical evaluation:
    - Characterize the number of basic operations in both iterative and
      recursive algorithms.
    - Use the asymptotic notation and the characterization of its basic
      operations to classify an algorithm as belonging to a well-known
      worst-case time complexity class.
    - Using an algorithm's worst-case time complexity, compare and contrast it
      with other algorithms that have similar and different time complexities,
      explaining which algorithm is most appropriate depending on, for instance,
      the likely size of a program's input.
    - Describe ways in which it is possible to re-design an algorithm and the
      way in which it processes a data structure so as to improve its worst-case
      time complexity.
    - Explain how the algorithm exhibits trade-offs between its worst-case time
      complexity and the amount of space that it needs to store the data
      structure.
- Given the Python-based implementation of a data structure and the algorithm
  that processes and/or manipulates it, perform these steps as part of its
  empirical evaluation:
    - Implement a benchmarking framework that repeatedly executes an algorithm
      through a doubling experiment in which the size of the input repeatedly
      doubles.
    - Use the benchmarking framework to run a doubling experiment for an
      algorithm, computing the doubling ratio for execution time at each stage
      of a benchmark.
    - Use the computed doubling ratio to experimentally predict the likely
      worst-case time complexity class to which the data structure and algorithm
      belong.
    - Leveraging both the likely worst-case time complexity and the experimental
      data reported from the doubling experiment run by the benchmarking
      framework, describe ways in which it is possible to re-design the
      algorithm to improve its performance.
    - Using the likely worst-case time complexity and the experimental data,
      explain how the algorithm trades-off between time efficiency and the space
      needed for data storage.
- For the implementation of a data structure and its associated algorithms in
  the Python programming language, use the results from both the analytical and
  empirical evaluation to:
    - Confidently classify the algorithm according to its worst-case time
      complexity.
    - Identify strengths and weakness in terms of both time and space
      efficiency.
    - Suggest ways to improve the efficiency of the Python implementation.
