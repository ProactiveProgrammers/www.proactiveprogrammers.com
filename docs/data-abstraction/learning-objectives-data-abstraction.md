## Data Structures

A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following skills in data structures:

### Engineering Efforts

- Correctly implement a data structure, such as a stack, list, or dictionary,
  ensuring that it provides all of the functionality required by the structure's
  specification.
- After importing an existing implementation of a data structure (e.g., a list
  or a dictionary), confirm that it provides the required functionality and
  integrate it into an existing program.
- Adapt an existing implementation of a data structure so that it offers
  additional and/or different functionality not provided by that structure's
  standard implementation.
- Leveraging knowledge of existing data structures like a list or dictionary:
    - Specify the input, output, and behavior of a new data structure.
    - Design, implement, and document a new data structure.
    - Implement, execute, and maintain a test suite for a new data structure and
      demonstrate that, for given input and output, its behavior matches the
      specification.
    - Integrate the new data structure with the data structures used by an
      existing program.
    - Document the trade-offs associated with the implementation of the new data
      structure, comparing and contrasting it with existing alternatives and
      justifying the need for the bespoke imlementation instead of those that
      are already available.

  Write Learning
  Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
  details about how to design learning objectives for a academic course. From
  your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
  clear and measurable?
