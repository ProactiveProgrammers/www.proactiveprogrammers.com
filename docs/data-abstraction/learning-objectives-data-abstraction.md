## Data Structures

A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following skills in data structures:

### Engineering Efforts

- Correctly implement a data structure, such as a stack, list, or dictionary,
  ensuring that it provides all of the functionality required by the structure's
  specification.
- After important an existing implementation of a data structure (e.g., a list
  or a dictionary), confirm that it provides the required functionality and
  integrate it into an existing program.
- Adapt an existing implementation of a data structure so that it offers
  additional and/or different functionality not provided by that structure's
  standard implementation.
- Leveraging knowledge of existing data structures, specify the input, output,
  and behavior of a new data structure to solve a novel problem.
- Design, implement, and document a data structure

  Write Learning
  Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
  details about how to design learning objectives for a academic course. From
  your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
  clear and measurable?
