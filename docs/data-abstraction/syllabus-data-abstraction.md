### Course Description

A continuation of CMPSC 100 with an emphasis on implementing, using, and
evaluating the computational structures needed to efficiently store and retrieve
digital data. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork,
students create data structures and algorithms whose correctness and performance
they study through proofs and experimentation. Students continue to refine their
ability to organize and document a program's source code so that it effectively
communicates with the intended users and maintainers. During a weekly laboratory
session, students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects,
reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Required Textbook

[Introduction to Computation and Programming Using
Python](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/introduction-computation-and-programming-using-python-third-edition)
by [John V. Guttag](https://people.csail.mit.edu/guttag/)

### Course Policies

#### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the
assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category               | Percentage |
|------------------------| -----------|
| Technical Assessments  |  10%       |
| Midterm Examination    |  10%       |
| Final Examination      |  10%       |
| Source Code Surveys    |  20%       |
| Programming Projects   |  20%       |
| Engineering Efforts    |  30%       |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Technical Assessments**: These cumulative weekly online assessments will
    cover all course content introduced to date. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take
    these technical assessments on the scheduled day.

-   **Midterm Examination**: The midterm is an online cumulative assessment
    covering all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to take this
    test on the scheduled date and complete the test in the stated period of
    time.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is an online cumulative assessment covering
    all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory sessions, as
    outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are made with the
    course instructor, all students will be expected to take this test on the
    scheduled date and complete the test in the stated period of time.

-   **Source Code Surveys**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbooks and the content covered during that day's
    in-person classroom session, technical challenges have the following goals:
    (i) help a learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by
    recalling facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the
    textbooks and (ii) allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts
    and ideas by translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas
    presented in the textbooks.

-   **Programming Projects**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbooks, the content covered during that week's in-person
    classroom session, and the weekly technical challenges, the practical
    assignments further equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of
    discrete structures by applying --- in a new way --- their knowledge of the
    facts, techniques, and rules of discrete mathematics and rigorous Python
    programming.

-   **Laboratory Assignments**: These assignments invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments will invite
    students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern
    Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right
    balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization.
    Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to
    evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for
    instance, its efficiency and correctness.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date share through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and Google Calendar. Electronic versions of the engineering efforts,
programming projects, and source code surveys must be submitted to a student's
GitHub repository. No credit will be awarded for any course work that is not
submitted to your GitHub repository with the required name. Unless special
arrangements are made with the instructor, no work will be accepted after the
published deadline.

#### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your assignment's
GitHub repository, you will privately receive a grade for and feedback on each
assignment. Your grade will be a function of whether or you not completed
correct work and submitted it by the deadline.
