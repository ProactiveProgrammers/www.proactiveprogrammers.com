# Integer Squaring

## Project Goals

This engineering effort invites you to combine what you learned about the basics
of Python programming to implement a useful program that can compute the square
for all of the integer values stored inside of a file. In addition to fixing
defects in the provided source code, you will create your own Python functions
that use both iteration constructs and conditional logic to implement a
correct program that passes the test suite and all checks. As you enhance your
[technical skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/), you will
program with tools such as VS Code and a terminal window and the Python
programming language and the Poetry package manager.

## Project Access

If you are a student enrolled in a Computer Science class at Allegheny College,
you can access this assignment by clicking the link provided to you in Discord.
Once you click this link it will create a GitHub repository that you can clone
to your computer by following the general-purpose instructions in the
description of the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/). Specifically, you
will need to use the `git clone` command to download the project from GitHub to
your computer. Now you are ready to add source code and documentation to the
project!

## Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a number squaring program called `square`.
The program can accept as input both a file of numbers and the name of an
approach to squaring an integer. If you run the program correctly, it will
iterate through the file of numbers, compute the square for each number, and
output a complete list of the squared values. For instance, if you run the
program with the command `poetry run square --approach for --dir input --file
numbers.txt` it produces this output:

```shell
ðŸ˜ƒ Squaring numbers in a file called input/numbers.txt!

[
    5184,
    841,
    3721,
    1764,
    1936,
    ...
]
```

In addition to having a feature that lets you square numbers using a `for` loop,
the `square` program can perform the same task by using a `while` loop! If you
run the program with the command `poetry run square --approach while --dir input
--file numbers.txt` then the program should produce the same output as given
above this paragraph. If you run the command `poetry run square --help` you
should see the following output that explains how to use the `square` program:

```shell
Usage: square [OPTIONS]

  Iteratively square all integers in a file.

Options:
  --approach [for|while]  [default: for]
  --dir PATH
  --file PATH
  --install-completion    Install completion for the current shell.
  --show-completion       Show completion for the current shell, to copy
                          it or customize the installation.

  --help                  Show this message and exit.
```

Please note that the provided source code does not contain all of the
functionality to produce this output. As explain in the next section, you are
invited to add all of the missing features and ensure that `square` produces the
expected output. Once the program is working correctly, you should also try to
use it when specifying a file that is not available on your computer! For instance,
if you run it with the command `poetry run square --approach for --dir input
--file numberswrong.txt` then it will not perform the number squaring and
instead produce the following output:

```shell
ðŸ˜ƒ Squaring numbers in a file called input/numberswrong.txt!

ðŸ¤· input/numberswrong.txt was not a valid file! Sorry, cannot square the
numbers!
```

???+ note

    Don't forget that if you want to run the `square` program you must use your
    terminal window to first go into the GitHub repository containing this
    project and then go into the `square` directory that contains the project's
    source code. Finally, remember that before running the program you must run
    `poetry install` to add the dependencies.

## Adding Functionality

If you study the file `square/square/main.py` you will see that it has many
`TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you need to
implement before `square` will produce correct output. If you run the provided
test suite with the command `poetry run task test` you will see that it produces
output like the following:

```
tests/test_square.py:5: in <module>
    from square import main
square/main.py:15: in <module>
    cli = typer.Typer()
E   NameError: name 'typer' is not defined
```

Alternatively, running the program with a command like `poetry run square
--approach for --dir input --file numbers.txt` will produce the following
output:

```
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<string>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/gkapfham/.pyenv/versions/3.9.2/lib/python3.9/importlib/__init__.py", line 127, in import_module
    return _bootstrap._gcd_import(name[level:], package, level)
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1030, in _gcd_import
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 1007, in _find_and_load
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 986, in _find_and_load_unlocked
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 680, in _load_unlocked
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap_external>", line 790, in exec_module
  File "<frozen importlib._bootstrap>", line 228, in _call_with_frames_removed
    cli = typer.Typer()
NameError: name 'typer' is not defined
```

This output suggests that the `typer` module was not correctly imported! After
importing this module in the appropriate fashion, all while following the
relevant instructions in the description of the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/), you should find the
other `TODO` markers and correctly resolve them. For instance, you can add this
function to the `main.py` file:

```python
def confirm_valid_file(file: Path) -> bool:
    """Confirm that the provided file is a valid path."""
    # determine if the file is not None and if it is a file
    if file is not None:
        # the file is valid
        if file.is_file():
            return True
    # the file was either none or not valid
    return False
```

In addition to `confirm_valid_file`, you must completely implement these
functions:

- `def compute_square_while(value: int) -> int`
- `def compute_square_for(value: int) -> int`
- `def compute_square_iterative(contents: str, square_function: Callable[[int], int]) -> List[int]:`

It is worth noting that the `compute_square_iterative` function is a
higher-order function that accepts as one of its inputs the `square_function`
that should be either `compute_square_for` or `compute_square_while`. The person
running the `square` program can pick which of these functions the program will
call by specifying either `for` or `while` as one of the program's command-line
arguments. The `square` program uses the Typer package and the following source
code to ensure that the program only accepts one of these two options. For
instance, if you try to run the program with the command `poetry run square
--approach recursion --dir input --file numbers.txt` it will produce the
following error message because `recursion` is not a valid option:

```
Usage: square [OPTIONS]
Try 'square --help' for help.

Error: Invalid value for '--approach': invalid choice: recursion. (choose from for, while)
```

## Running Checks

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that
it includes the following section:

```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
black = { cmd = "black square tests --check", help = "Run the black checks for source code format" }
flake8 = { cmd = "flake8 square tests", help = "Run the flake8 checks for source code documentation" }
mypy = { cmd = "poetry run mypy square", help = "Run the mypy type checker for potential type errors" }
pydocstyle = { cmd = "pydocstyle square tests", help = "Run the pydocstyle checks for source code documentation" }
pylint = { cmd = "pylint square tests", help = "Run the pylint checks for source code documentation" }
test = { cmd = "pytest -x -s", help = "Run the pytest test suite" }
test-silent = { cmd = "pytest -x --show-capture=no", help = "Run the pytest test suite without showing output" }
all = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint && task mypy && task test"
lint = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint"
```

This section makes it easy to run commands like `poetry run task lint` to
automatically run all of the linters designed to check the Python source code in
your program and its test suite. You can also use the command `poetry run task
black` to confirm that your source code adheres to the industry-standard format
defined by the `black` tool. If it does not adhere to the standard then you can
run the command `poetry run black square tests` and it will automatically
reformat the source code.

Along with running tasks like `poetry run task list`, you can leverage the
relevant instructions in the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) to enter into a Docker
container and run the command `gradle grade` to check your work. If `gradle
grade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you made progress towards
correctly implementing and writing about `square`.

If your program has all of the anticipated functionality, you can run the
command `poetry run task test` and see that the test suite produces output like
this:

```shell
collected 5 items

tests/test_square.py .....
```

???+ note

    Don't forget that when you commit source code or technical writing to your
    GitHub repository for this project, it will trigger the run of a GitHub
    Actions workflow. If you are a student at Allegheny College, then running
    this workflow consumes build minutes for the course's organization! As such,
    you should only commit to your repository once you have made substantive
    changes to your project and you are ready to confirm its correctness. Before
    you commit to your repository, you can still run checks on your own computer
    by either using Poetry or Docker and GatorGrader.

## Project Reflection

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented, and answer all of the other questions about your experiences in
completing this project.

## Project Assessment

Since this project is an engineering effort, it is aligned with the
**evaluating** and **creating** levels of [Bloom's
taxonomy](proactive-learning/blooms-taxonomy/). You can learn more about how a
proactive programming expert will assess your work by examining the [assessment
strategy](/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/). From the start to the end
of this project you may make an unlimited number of reattempts at submitting
source code and technical writing that meet every aspect of the project's
specification.
