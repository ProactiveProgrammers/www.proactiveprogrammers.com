In the book called [*A Philosophy of Software
Design*](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php), [John
Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) defines an
abstraction as "a simplified view of an entity, which omits important details.
Abstractions are useful because they make it easier for us to think about and
manipulate complex things." Abstraction is a powerful tool that enables software
engineers to solve complex problems. The **data abstraction** course will teach
you how to effectively use several different types of abstractions as you solve
problems and build software!

Using Python, you will first learn about the **programming abstractions** (e.g.,
iteration, recursion, and functions) that are the basic building blocks of
computer programs. Second, you will explore the abstractions in
**object-oriented programming** (e.g., inheritance, encapsulation, and
polymorphism) that enable software engineers to create and maintain large-scale
systems. Using the two previous types of abstractions, you will learn how to
create and use abstractions like **data structures** (e.g., lists and
dictionaries) and **algorithms** (e.g., searching and sorting) as you form the
reliable building blocks of complex programs. Finally, you will use
**performance evaluation** abstractions (e.g., worst-case time complexity and
doubling experiments) to study the efficiency of all the other data
abstractions. Let's learn more about how to confidently create complex software!
