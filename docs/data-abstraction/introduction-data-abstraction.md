In the book [*A Philosophy of Software
Design*](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php) [John
Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) defines an
abstraction as "a simplified view of an entity, which omits important details.
Abstractions are useful because they make it easier for us to think about and
manipulate complex things."
