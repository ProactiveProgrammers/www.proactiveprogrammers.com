# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Technical Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore data abstraction with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the list of [proactive
  technical skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).


## Python Foundations

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, variables, conditional logic, and iteration
  constructs, as provided by Python, to implement programs that, for instance,
  find out if a number is even or odd, compute a number's square, or determine
  if a number is divisible by another number?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/data-abstraction/python-foundations/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Syntax**: the structure of a programming language that defines what
      characters and symbols are well formed
    - **Semantics**: the way in which a programming language associates meaning
      with syntactically correct programs
    - **Notional Machine**: idealized abstraction of both computer hardware and
      the semantics of a computer program
    - **Reserved Word**: a keyword in Python that has a built-in meaning and
      cannot be used for a variable's name
    - **Type Checking**: automated process to confirm the compatibility of the
      types for both variables and operations

## Numerical Computation

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, floating-point variables, conditional logic, and
  iteration constructs to implement both exhaustive and approximate approaches
  to compute (i) the square root of a number, (ii) the logarithm of a number,
  and (iii) the roots of a polynomial function?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/data-abstraction/numerical-computation/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Numerical Approximation**: an alternative to the exact value for a
      function that is close enough to be useful
    - **Floating Point**: representing a decimal value with two integers, one
      for significant digits and one for exponent
    - **Binary Number**: representation of a number using only a sequence of
      bits, or digits that must only be 0 or 1
    - **Quadratic Root**: value(s) of a quadratic function where it intercepts
      the horizontal axis
    - **Square Root**: mathematical function that is the inverse of the square
      of a number

## Function Scope

### Technical Question

- How can I use Python's scoping rules and the principle of abstraction to
  create modularized and/or higher-order functions that are easy to understand,
  implement, test, and maintain?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 4 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/data-abstraction/function-scope/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Function Specification**: the assumptions and guarantees in the contract
      between function creator and caller
    - **Formal Parameters**: a function's input parameter, given a name and a
      type in the function's declaration
    - **Actual Parameters**: the arguments to a function that are passed into it
      at the function invocation point
    - **Debugging**: the systematic process of finding out what a program does
      not work and then fixing it
    - **Higher-Order Function**: general-purpose functions for problem solving
      that accept functions as input

## Structured Types

### Technical Question

- How can I use Python's structured types (e.g., `str`, `list`, `range`, and
  `dict`) to implement programs that efficiently store and retrieve data?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 5 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Tuple**: immutable ordered sequence that can contain elements of
      any type
    - **List**: ordered sequence of values where each value is identified by
      an index
    - **Set**: unordered collection of unique elements used for data storage
    - **Shallow Copy**: creation of a new list that involves inserting contained
      objects into a new list
    - **Dictionary**: container structure like a list, except for the fact that
      it is indexed with a key

## Learning Opportunities

Interested in learning more about any of the topics on this schedule? If you
are, then make sure to connect with members of the [proactive
community](../../proactive-community/introduction-proactive-community) for more
learning opportunities. Remember, this course emphasizes building mastery of the
course's [learning
objectives](../learning-objectives-data-abstraction) through
"learning by doing", as explained in the description of [proactive
learning](../../proactive-learning/introduction-proactive-learning). As such,
you can best understand the content on this schedule by completing all the
source code surveys, programming projects, and engineering efforts!
