  help me to rigorously explore data abstraction with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

  technical skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).


## Python Foundations

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, variables, conditional logic, and iteration
  constructs, as provided by Python, to implement programs that, for instance,
  find out if a number is even or odd, compute a number's square, or determine
  if a number is divisible by another number?

### Reading Assignments

- Check out the [course slides](/slides/data-abstraction/python-foundations/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Syntax**: the structure of a programming language that defines what
      characters and symbols are well formed

      with syntactically correct programs
    - **Notional Machine**: idealized abstraction of both computer hardware and

      types for both variables and operations

## Numerical Computation

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, floating-point variables, conditional logic, and
  iteration constructs to implement both exhaustive and approximate approaches
  to compute (i) the square root of a number, (ii) the logarithm of a number,
  and (iii) the roots of a polynomial function?

      for significant digits and one for exponent
    - **Binary Number**: representation of a number using only a sequence of
      bits, or digits that must only be 0 or 1

      of a number

## Function Scope

  create modularized and/or higher-order functions that are easy to understand,
  implement, test, and maintain?

      between function creator and caller
    - **Formal Parameters**: a function's input parameter, given a name and a
      type in the function's declaration
    - **Actual Parameters**: the arguments to a function that are passed into it
      at the function invocation point
    - **Debugging**: the systematic process of finding out why a program does
      not work and then fixing it
    - **Higher-Order Function**: general-purpose functions for problem solving
      that accept functions as input

## Structured Types

### Technical Question

- How can I use Python's structured types (e.g., `str`, `list`, `range`, and
  `dict`) to implement programs that efficiently store and retrieve data?

### Reading Assignments

      any type
    - **List**: ordered sequence of values where each value is identified by
      an index
    - **Set**: unordered collection of unique elements used for data storage
    - **Dictionary**: container structure like a list, except for the fact that
      it is indexed with a key
    - **Shallow Copy**: creation of a new list that involves inserting contained
      objects into a new list

## Program Components

### Technical Question

- How can I use different types of program components, such as recursive
  functions, modules, libraries, and files to implement efficient programs with
  effective designs?

### Reading Assignments

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Recursive Function**: function that repeatedly calls itself until
      reaching a base case that stops recursion
    - **Global Variable**: a variable that is accessible to all of the functions
      in a module
    - **Module**: a Python file that contains definitions of variables and
      functions accessible to a program
    - **Standard Library**: collection of packages available to all Python
      programs through an import statement
    - **File**: disk-based storage mechanism that contains content created by
      humans and/or computer programs

## Software Testing

      that establishes a parent-child relationship
