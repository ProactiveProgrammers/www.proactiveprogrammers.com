# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Technical Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore data abstraction with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the list of [proactive
  technical skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).

## Python Foundations

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, variables, conditional logic, and iteration
  constructs, as provided by the Python programming language, to implement
  programs that, for instance, compute a number's square or determine if a
  number is divisible by another number?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*

???+ note "Technical Concept Review"

    - **Syntax**: the structure of a programming language that defines what
      characters and symbols are well formed
    - **Semantics**: the way in which a programming language associates meaning
      with syntactically correct programs
    - **Notional Machine**: idealized abstraction of both computer hardware and
      the semantics of a computer program
    - **Reserved Word**: a keyword in Python that has a built-in meaning and
      cannot be used for a variable's name
    - **Type Checking**: automated process to confirm the compatibility of the
      types for both variables and operations

## Numerical Computation

### Technical Question

- How can I use functions, floating-point variables, conditional logic, and
  iteration constructs to implement both exhaustive and approximate approaches
  to compute (i) the square root of a number, (ii) the logarithm of a number,
  and (iii) the roots of a polynomial function?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Introduction to Computation and Programming Using Python*

???+ note "Technical Concept Review"

    - **Numerical Approximation**: an alternative to the exact value for a
      function that is close enough to be useful
    - **Floating Point**: representing a decimal value with two integers, one
      for significant digits and one for exponent
    - **Binary Number**: representation of a number using only a sequence of
      bits, or digits that must only be 0 or 1
    - **Quadratic Root**: value(s) of a quadratic function where it intercepts
      the horizontal axis
    - **Square Root**: mathematical function that is the inverse of the square
      of a number
