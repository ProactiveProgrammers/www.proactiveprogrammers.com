# Square Roots

## Project Goals

This assignment invites you to implement a program that features multiple
algorithms for computing the square root of a number. You will implement two
algorithms that use iteration constructs to approximate the square root of a
number. For a given step size and a tolerance level saying how close the
approximation must be, the exhaustive algorithm check if each possible answer is
within a specified tolerance for the square root's approximation. In contrast,
the efficient algorithm will use bisection search to rapidly prune the search to
the best possible approximation of the number's square root. In addition to
adding source code and documentation to the provided Python files, you will
conduct an experiment to determine which algorithm is the fastest and estimate
by how much it is faster. As you enhance your [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) and explore the
experimental evaluation of algorithms, you will continue to program with tools
such as VS Code and a terminal window and the Python programming language and
the Poetry package manager.

## Project Access

If you are a student enrolled in a Computer Science class at Allegheny College,
you can access this assignment by clicking the link provided to you in Discord.
Once you click this link it will create a GitHub repository that you can clone
to your computer by following the general-purpose instructions in the
description of the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/). Specifically, you
will need to use the `git clone` command to download the project from GitHub to
your computer. Now you are ready to add source code and documentation to the
project!

## Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a square root calculation program called
`squareroot`. The program accepts through its command-line a single integer
value for which it will compute the square root using either an `efficient` or
an `exhaustive` approach. Finally, the `squareroot` program offers a `--profile`
flag that causes it to use the
[Pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument) package to collect
timing information about the efficiency of the chosen method. If you use Poetry
to run the program with the command `poetry run squareroot --number 25000
--approach exhaustive --profile` it produces the following output:

```shell
ðŸ§® Attempting to calculate the square root of 25000!

âœ¨ Was this search for the square root successful? Yes
âœ¨ How many guesses did it take to compute the solution? 1581139
âœ¨ The best approximation for the square root of 25000 is 158.1139000041253

```

If you run the program with the command `poetry run squareroot --number 25000
--approach efficient --profile` then it produces output like:

```shell
ðŸ§® Attempting to calculate the square root of 25000!

âœ¨ Was this search for the square root successful? Yes
âœ¨ How many guesses did it take to compute the solution? 27
âœ¨ The best approximation for the square root of 25000 is 158.11389312148094

Program: squareroot --number 25000 --approach efficient --profile

No samples were recorded.
```

It is worth noting that the `exhaustive` algorithm took `1581139` guesses to
approximate the square root of `25000` while the `efficient` algorithm only
needed `27`! This shows that `efficient`'s bisection search algorithm is
significantly faster than the `exhaustive` approach. Interestingly, the
[Pyinstrument](https://github.com/joerick/pyinstrument) package reports that it
could not record any performance data for `squareroot` when the program runs in
`efficient` mode. Why do you think that this is the case? Is there any way to
overcome this issue by, for instance, reconfiguring Pyinstrument or changing the
input that you pass to the program? Overall, how much faster is `efficient` in
comparison to `exhaustive`? You can use the equations and suggestions in the
engineering effort about [primality
testing](../../engineering-efforts/primality-testing) to calculate the
percentage change in execution time when running `squareroot` in `efficient`
mode instead of the `exhaustive` mode. Finally, to understand why `efficient` is
faster than `exhaustive` you should study each function's source code and the
textbook's content.

To learn more about how to run this program, you can type the command `poetry
run squareroot --help` to see the following output showing how to use `squareroot`:

```shell
Usage: squareroot [OPTIONS]

  Use iteration to perform square root computation of a number and then
  perform profiling to capture execution time.

Options:
  --number INTEGER                [default: 5]
  --profile / --no-profile        [default: False]
  --approach [exhaustive|efficient]
                                  [default: efficient]
  --install-completion            Install completion for the current shell.
  --show-completion               Show completion for the current shell, to
                                  copy it or customize the installation.

  --help                          Show this message and exit.
```

Please note that the provided source code does not contain all of the
functionality to produce this output. As explained in the next section, you are
invited to add the missing features and ensure that `squareroot` produces the
expected output. Once the program is working correctly, it should produce output
similar to that shown in this section.

???+ note

    Don't forget that if you want to run the `squareroot` program you must use
    your terminal to first go into the GitHub repository containing this project
    and then go into the `squareroot/` directory that houses the project's code.
    Finally, remember that before running the program you must run `poetry
    install` to add the dependencies.

## Adding Functionality

If you study the file `squareroot/squareroot/main.py` you will see that it has
many `TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you need to
implement before `squareroot` will produce correct output. In summary, you
should implement the following functions for the `squareroot` program:

- `def compute_square_root_exhaustive(x: int, epsilon: float = 0.01) -> Tuple[bool, float, int]`
- `def compute_square_root_efficient(x: int, epsilon: float = 0.01) -> Tuple[bool, float, int]`

Importantly, you will notice that both `compute_square_root_efficient` and
`compute_square_root_exhaustive` accept the same types of inputs and produce the
same types of outputs. In particular, the parameter called `x` is the number
whose square root the function will compute and `epsilon` is the tolerance
parameter describing how close the approximation of `x`'s square root must be.
The notation `Tuple[bool, float, int]` that describes the output of these
functions shows that they each return three values. The first variable in the
return value is a `bool` indicating whether or not the function found an answer
within the tolerance of `epsilon`. Finally, the second returned variable is a
`float` for the calculated value of the square root and the third one is an
`int` for the number of guesses that the algorithm took.

You will also notice that there are some `TODO` markers in the `squareroot`
function of the `main` module. In the scope of the conditional logic statement
`if approach.value == SquareRootCalculationingApproach.efficient` on lines `1`
through `7`, the program should call the function
`compute_square_root_efficient` depending on whether the `profile` variable
specified on the command-line is `True` or `False`. If `profile` is `True`, then
the program should use Pyinstrument to measure its execution time, as
illustrated on lines `3` through `5`. However, if `profile` is `False`, then the
program should only call the `compute_square_root_efficient` as shown on line
`7`. As lines `9` through `15` show, the function should take analogous steps
for its `exhaustive` mode, calling the `compute_square_root_exhaustive` instead
of `compute_square_root_efficient`.

```python linenums="1"
if approach.value == SquareRootCalculationingApproach.efficient:
    if profile:
        profiler.start()
        square_root_tuple = compute_square_root_efficient(number)
        profiler.stop()
    else:
        square_root_tuple = compute_square_root_efficient(number)
# use the exhaustive square root computation algorithm
elif approach.value == SquareRootCalculationingApproach.exhaustive:
    if profile:
        profiler.start()
        square_root_tuple = compute_square_root_exhaustive(number)
        profiler.stop()
    else:
        square_root_tuple = compute_square_root_exhaustive(number)
```

Once you have correctly resolved all of the `TODO` markers in the `squareroot`
program, it should produce the expected output described in the previous
section. With that said, please bear in mind that, when running `squareroot`
with the `--profile` flag it will produce different profiling data depending on
the performance of your computer.

## Running Checks

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that it
includes a section that specifies different executable tasks like
`lint`. If you are in the `squareroot/` directory that contains the `pyproject.toml`
file and the `poetry.lock` file, the tasks in this section make it easy to run
commands like `poetry run task lint` to automatically run all of the linters
designed to check the Python source code in your program and its test suite. You
can also use the command `poetry run task black` to confirm that your source
code adheres to the industry-standard format defined by the `black` tool. If it
does not adhere to the standard then you can run the command `poetry run black
squareroot tests` or, alternatively, `poetry run task fixformat`, and it will
automatically reformat the code!

Along with running tasks like `poetry run task lint`, you can leverage the
relevant instructions in the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) to run the command
`gatorgrade --config config/gatorgrade.yml` to check your work. If your work
meets the baseline requirements and adheres to the best practices that
proactive programmers adopt you will see that all the checks pass when you run
`gatorgrade`. You can study the `config/gatorgrade.yml` file in your repository
to learn how the :material-github:
[GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program runs
:material-github: [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader)
to automatically check your program and technical writing.

If your program has all of the anticipated functionality, you can run the
command `poetry run task test` and see that the test suite passes and produces
output like this:

```shell
collected 3 items

tests/test_squareroot.py ....
```

???+ note

    Don't forget that when you commit source code or technical writing to your
    GitHub repository for this project, it will trigger the run of a GitHub
    Actions workflow. If you are a student at Allegheny College, then running
    this workflow consumes build minutes for the course's organization! As
    such, you should only commit to your repository once you have made
    substantive changes to your project and you are ready to confirm its
    correctness. Before you commit to your repository, you can still run checks
    on your own computer by using the :material-github:
    [GatorGrade](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrade) program to run
    :material-github:
    [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).

## Project Reflection

Once you have finished all of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented and tested, compare and contrast the performance of different
implementations of the square root calculation, and answer all of the other
questions about your experiences in completing this project.

## Project Assessment

Since this is a programming project, it is aligned with the **applying** and
**analyzing** levels of [Bloom's taxonomy](/proactive-learning/blooms-taxonomy/).
You can learn more about how a proactive programming expert will assess your
work by examining the [assessment
strategy](/proactive-learning/assessment-strategy/). From the start to the end
of this project you may make an unlimited number of reattempts at submitting
source code and technical writing that meet all aspects of the project's
specification.
