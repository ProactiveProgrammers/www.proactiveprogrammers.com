# Python Packaging

It is common for a proactive programmer to run their Python programs in a
virtual environment that contains isolated versions of all the packages on which
a specific program depends. Although there are many different ways to package a
Python program and manage its dependencies, a new tool called
[Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) offers a flexible and easy-to-use approach.
Bearing in mind that the installation instructions for Poetry vary depending on
whether your computer runs Windows, MacOS, or Linux, follow the installation
instructions in the [Poetry Documentation](https://python-poetry.org/docs/) to
ensure that the `poetry --version` command displays the expected output in your
terminal window.
