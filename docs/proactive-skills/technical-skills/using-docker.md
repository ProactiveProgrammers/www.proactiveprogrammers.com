# Using Docker

[//]: # (Stress difficulties, encourage not to upgrade once working)

## Introduction

Docker Desktop and Docker Engine make it possible for a proactive programmer to
download a Docker container that contains all of the software that they need to
complete a programming project. This means that, instead of having to separately
download all of the dependencies for a project, you can download a single Docker
container that contains all of them! Exciting, right? While it is exciting,
there is a challenge as well: Docker Desktop is often difficult to download,
install, and configure on Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, and MacOS. Once
you have Docker working correctly for all of the Docker contains that the
projects on this site invite you to use, it is best for you to defer any
upgrades to Docker Desktop until you are not facing time-sensitive deadlines.

## Requirements Check

If you are a student at Allegheny College, you must complete your course
projects using a [Department Approved
Laptop](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/resources/laptops/). This is primarily due
to the fact that your laptop must be approved for running [Docker
Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) on MacOS and Windows
and [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) on Linux. If
you are not sure whether or not your computer supports Docker, you can visit the
[Can I Run Docker?](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/canirundocker/) web site and
the see if Docker will work correctly. It is worth taking a minute to review the
requirements for using Docker by visiting the following web sites:
