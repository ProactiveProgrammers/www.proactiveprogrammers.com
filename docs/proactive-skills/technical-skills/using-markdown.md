# Using Markdown

## Introduction

Proactive programmers normally don't use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit
either their source code or their technical documentation. Instead, you can use
[VS Code](../technical-skills/using-vscode.md) to write all of your
documentation in a markup language called Markdown. Guess what? A significant
amount of the content on this site was written in Markdown! You can learn some
of the features of Markdown by studying this site's [source
code](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com) and
reading the following resources that will help you to learn how to use Markdown
for technical writing.

## Features

Markdown offers several constructs that support technical writing, including the
following:

* Inline source code samples
* Fenced source code block
* Nestable sections
* Ordered and unordered lists
* Links to images and web sites

A platform like [GitHub](https://github.com/) can render Markdown into text that
looks like you wrote it in a word processor! You can learn more about these
constructs by checking these resources.

## Resources

- [Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/)
- [Markdown Tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/)
- [Markdown and Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown)
- [Markdownlint Markdown Linting Tool](https://github.com/markdownlint/markdownlint)

It is worth noting that the last tool in this list is called a "linter" because
it can check for small mistakes in a programmer's technical writing. Many
proactive programmers use linters in [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) to ensure that they don't write
Markdown that does not display correctly when a web browser views the technical
writing in a GitHub repository.

Okay, now let's learn how to install, configure, and use a terminal application!
