# Using Markdown

## Introduction

Proactive programmers normally don't use Google Docs or Microsoft Word to edit
either their source code or their technical documentation. Instead, you can use
[VS Code](../technical-skills/using-vscode.md) to write all of your
documentation in a markup language called Markdown. Guess what? A significant
amount of the content on this site was written in Markdown! You can learn some
of the features of Markdown by studying this site's [source
code](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com) of
reading the following resources that will help you to learn how to use
Markdown for technical writing.
