To become a proactive programmer you need to become comfortable with and then a
master of a wide variety of technical skills that include using a text editor
and a terminal window and testing and debugging your program. When faced with an
array of technical skills that you need to master, it is worth asking: how do I
get good at all of these skills? While there are a lot of skills that you will
should develop as you emerge as a proactive programmer, it is exciting to report
that there are some proven strategies towards mastering them!

Have you ever heard that, to master a skill, you primarily need to devote 10,000
hours to practicing it? While practice is, in fact, really important, it seems
that the "10,000 hours rule" in a
[misinterpretation](https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/anders-ericsson/) of
the research of K. Anders Ericsson. So, what does work? Well, [Greg
Wilson](https://third-bit.com/) writes in [*Teaching Tech
Together*](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) that "what actually works
is doing similar but subtly different things, paying attention to what works and
what doesn't, and then changing behavior in response to that feedback to get
cumulatively better." Specifically, to master the technical skills introduced on
this site you need to participate in deliberate practice that "requires both a
clear performance goal and immediate informative feedback".[^1] Here is a
summary from [Teaching Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html)
of the stages you should take when learning these technical skills:

- **Act on feedback from others**: while attempting to install, configure, and
  use a program on your laptop (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
  or [Python](https://www.python.org/)), ask another programmer who has already
  successfully accomplished this task what they think of your setup and the
  approach that you took to create it. Next, listen carefully to their feedback
  and then attempt to improve your setup as needed, asking for clarification as
  appropriate.

[^1]: See Merriam-Webster for the definition of [Teaching Tech
  Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) for more details about how
  to effectively learn technical skills. What do you think that it takes for you
  to master the skills of a proactive programmer?
