# Python Programming

## Introduction

Before you attempt to install the Python Programming language on your computer,
it is worth taking time to build a mental model about what a Python program
actually is and what happens when it runs on your computer. Sounds abstract,
right? In a way, it is! But, building and regularly updating a mental model for
Python programs will eliminate some of the confusion that arises when your
program does something initially unexpected.

## Notional Machine

The book called [Teaching Tech
Together](https://teachtogether.tech/en/index.html) summarizes, in twelve
statements, a notional machine for the syntax, semantics, and behavior of a
Python program.
