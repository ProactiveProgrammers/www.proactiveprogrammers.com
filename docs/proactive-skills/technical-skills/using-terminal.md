# Using Terminal

## Introduction

The terminal window provides an interactive and text-based prompt that allows a
proactive programmer to type commands that complete tasks like the following
ones:

* Go into a directory
* Create or delete a directory or a file
* Delete a directory or a file
* Copy a file or directory to a new location

If you have previously used a graphical file browser other tools for
manipulating the files and directory on your computer, then you may be wondering
about whether or not there is any benefit to using a terminal window! While
proactive programmers have different preferences and ultimately adopt the tools
that best suit their professional needs, the experiences of many suggest that
&mdash; after becoming accustomed to a terminal window &mdash; it is possible to
complete common programming tasks more rapidly.

Depending on your operating system, you may already have a terminal window
installed on your development workstation. If you are using MacOS or Linux, then
you should search through the programs installed on your computer to see if you
already have a suitable terminal, such as `iTerm` on MacOS and `gnome-terminal`
on Ubuntu. If you are using Windows 10 Pro or Windows 10 Enterprise, then you
may have a terminal window called `cmd` or `powershell`. Regardless of which
terminal window is on your computer, run it and then explore the commands for
completing the tasks listed above, like going into and out of a directory.
