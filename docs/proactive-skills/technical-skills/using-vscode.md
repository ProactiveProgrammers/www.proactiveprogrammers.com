# Using VS Code

The team that creates and maintains the [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor describes it as "code editing
redefined" and points out that it is "free" and "built on open source" and that
it "runs everywhere". Sounds nice, huh? After you have reviewed the content on
VS Code's web site, follow the instructions to install in on the computer that
you will use for software development. Now, go ahead and take some time to
customize your text editor so that it uses a color scheme that matches your
style!
