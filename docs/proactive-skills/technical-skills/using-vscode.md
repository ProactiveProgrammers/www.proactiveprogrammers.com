# Using VS Code

## Introduction

The team that creates and maintains the [VS
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) text editor describes it as "code editing
redefined" and points out that it is "free" and "built on open source" and that
it "runs everywhere". Sounds nice, huh? After you have reviewed the content on
VS Code's web site, follow the instructions there to install in on the computer
that you will use for proactive programming. Now, go ahead and take some time to
customize your text editor so that it uses a color scheme that matches your
style!

## Extensions

To complete your setup of VS Code, please read about, install, configure, and
practice using the following VS Code extensions! While some of the extensions in
the following list are mandatory for you to become a successful proactive
programmer who uses Python (e.g., the [Python extension from
Microsoft](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)),
others are optionally installed at your discretion if you think the would be
helpful (e.g., [Bookmarks from Alessandro
Fragnani](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=alefragnani.Bookmarks)).
Make sure that you install extensions in each of the following categories!
