# Using GatorGrader

[//]: # (Excerpted from prior docs on GatorGrader and Dockagator)

## Introduction

The projects on this web site integrate the
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) tool so that an
emerging proactive programmer can receive rapid feedback in either a GitHub
Actions build or in a Docker container running on their computer. Since each
project on this site overviews the checks that GatorGrader runs, the purpose of
this documentation is to explain how to run GatorGrader in a Docker container
using the [DockaGator](https://github.com/GatorEducator/dockagator) Docker
container that runs [GatorGradle](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgradle)
and ultimately results in performing the checks for a specific assignment.
