# Bloom's Taxonomy

As you embark on the adventure of learning how to become a proactive programmer,
it is important for you to know how the projects on this site were designed in
terms of the type of learning they support and the difficulty or complexity of
the tasks they ask you to complete.[^1]


To ensure conformity with the standard definitions in the education field, what
follows is a description of these levels is directly quoted from [Teaching Tech
Together](https://teachtogether.tech/), which is available for free download in
English and Spanish.

- **Remembering**: Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling
  facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers.

    * **Keywords**: recognize, list, describe, name, find.
    * **Example**: 

- **Understanding**:

  - **Definition**: Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing,
    comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main
    ideas.
  - **Keywords**: interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain.

- **Applying**:

  - **Definition**: Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts,
    techniques, and rules in a different way.
  - **Keywords**: build, identify, use, plan, select.

- **Analyzing**:

  - **Definition**: Examine and break information into parts by identifying
    motives or causes; make inferences and find evidence to support
    generalizations.
  - **Keywords**: compare, contrast, simplify.

- **Evaluating**:

  - **Definition**: Present and defend opinions by making judgments about
    information, validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of
    criteria.
  - **Keywords**: check, choose, critique, prove, rate.

- **Creating**:

  - **Definition**: Compile information together in a different way by
    combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions.
  - **Keywords**: design, construct, improve, adapt, maximize, solve.

    In the context of programming, what level of the taxonomy is most exciting
    for you?
