# Bloom's Taxonomy

--8<-- "includes/admonitions/admonish-taxonomy.md"

As you become a proactive programmer, it is important for you to know how the
projects on this site were designed in terms of the learning type that they
support and the complexity of the tasks they ask you to complete.[^1] While you
may be thinking that this is only a topic for teachers, it turns out that
knowing the basics of this taxonomy is also helpful for learners! For instance,
this site creates assignments and learning objectives that are connected to
specific levels in this taxonomy.

Don't forget that these levels are organized from those that have the least
amount of cognitive complexity to those that have the most. Ready to see
examples of programming projects and how they connect to Bloom's taxonomy? Using
quotes from [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/)'s book called [Teaching Tech
Together](https://teachtogether.tech/), let's dive in to this description of the
taxonomy's levels and programming tasks.[^2]

- **Remembering**: Exhibit memory of previously learned material by recalling
  facts, terms, basic concepts, and answers.

    * **Keywords**: recognize, list, describe, name, find.
    * **Example**: Run a program that performs a numerical calculation, find the
      iteration construct used in the program, observe its output when run in
      the terminal window, and use a text editor to describe both the output and
      why the program produces it.

- **Understanding**: Demonstrate understanding of facts and ideas by organizing,
    comparing, translating, interpreting, giving descriptions, and stating main
    ideas.

    * **Keywords**: interpret, summarize, paraphrase, classify, explain.
    * **Example**: After running a program that performs the conversion of
      temperature values, organize it into separate functions with descriptive
      documentation and explain how the functions work together to produce the
      output observed when it is run.

- **Applying**:

  - **Definition**: Solve new problems by applying acquired knowledge, facts,
    techniques, and rules in a different way.
  - **Keywords**: build, identify, use, plan, select.

- **Analyzing**:

  - **Definition**: Examine and break information into parts by identifying
    motives or causes; make inferences and find evidence to support
    generalizations.
  - **Keywords**: compare, contrast, simplify.

- **Evaluating**:

  - **Definition**: Present and defend opinions by making judgments about
    information, validity of ideas, or quality of work based on a set of
    criteria.
  - **Keywords**: check, choose, critique, prove, rate.

- **Creating**:

  - **Definition**: Compile information together in a different way by
    combining elements in a new pattern or proposing alternative solutions.
  - **Keywords**: design, construct, improve, adapt, maximize, solve.

  Taxonomy for Flipped Learning
  Design](https://rtalbert.org/re-thinking-blooms-taxonomy-for-flipped-learning-design/)
  for a description of Bloom's taxonomy and how it aids the design of courses.
    In the context of programming, what level of the taxonomy is most exciting
    for you?

[^2]: Check out [Greg Wilson](https://third-bit.com/)'s book called [Teaching
  Tech Together](https://teachtogether.tech/) for lots of great ideas on how to
  teach programming to different types of learners. How could ideas from this
  book could be further applied to improve this learning platform?
