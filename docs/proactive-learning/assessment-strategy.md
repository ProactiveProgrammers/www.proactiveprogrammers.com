# Assessment Strategy

--8<-- "includes/admonitions/admonish-github.md"

All learners will complete all of their course work through an industry-standard
platform called [GitHub](https://www.github.com). All students will create a
free GitHub account at the start of the semester in which they take their
course. They will use this account and the GitHub repositories associated with
it to receive starter materials and submit the final version of each assignment.

Learners will receive rapid feedback on their work through a tool called
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader). The course
instructor will define GatorGrader checks for each type of course assignment and
your job will be to use a programming language, like Python, to implement a
complete solution that passes all of the GatorGrader checks. In addition to
running the GatorGrader tool on your laptop, learners will see the results from
running GatorGrader checks in the [GitHub
Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) continuous integration
environment.
