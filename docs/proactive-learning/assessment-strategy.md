# Assessment Strategy

All learners will complete all of their work through an industry-standard
platform called [GitHub](https://www.github.com). If they have not done so
already, learners should create a free GitHub account. They will use this
account and the GitHub repositories associated with it to receive starter
materials and submit the final version of each assignment.

Learners will receive rapid feedback on their work through a tool called
[GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader). The instructor will
define GatorGrader checks for each type of assignment and your job will be to
use a programming language, like Python, to implement a complete solution that
passes all of the GatorGrader checks. In addition to running the GatorGrader
tool on your laptop, learners will see the results from running GatorGrader
checks in the [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) continuous
integration environment.
