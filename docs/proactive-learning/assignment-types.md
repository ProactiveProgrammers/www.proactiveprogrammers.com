The book called [*The Mythical
Man-Month*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month), written by
[Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/), contains the
observation that "the magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One
types the correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,
showing things that never were nor could be." Wow, that makes programming sound
really exciting! And, it really is as enervating as Frederick P. Brooks, Jr.
makes it out to be. With that said, it can be overwhelming &mdash; and even
counter-productive &mdash; for an emerging proactive programmer to start their
journey by aiming to complete a useful software tool.

This site teaches proactive programming through three different types of
programming projects, each of which is connected to two of the levels in
[Bloom's Taxonomy](bloms-taxonomy.md) and therefore designed to develop your
programming knowledge and skills in a systematic and scaffolded fashion.
