# Data Analysis

## Project Goals

This engineering effort invites you to extend your knowledge about the basics of
data analysis to implement a program that can statistically analyze a data set
of real-world population records. After you finish the `dataanalysis` program it
will compute the summary statistics (e.g., mean, median, and standard deviation)
of population data from from 1970 until 2019. As you enhance your [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/), you will continue to
program with tools such as VS Code and both the Python programming language and
the Poetry package manager. Ultimately, your goal for this project is to create
a program that can efficiently process real-world data about human population
size.

## Project Access

If you are a student enrolled in a Computer Science class at Allegheny College,
you can access this assignment by clicking the link provided to you in Discord.
Once you click this link it will create a GitHub repository that you can clone
to your computer by following the general-purpose instructions in the
description of the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/). Specifically, you
will need to use the `git clone` command to download the project from GitHub to
your computer. Now you are ready to add source code and documentation to the
project!

## Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a data summarization program called
`dataanalysis`. The `dataanalysis` program takes as input a file of floating
point values and computes summary statistics about the numbers. Before you
continue to work on this assignment, please make sure that you understand the
meaning of the data in this file. To accomplish this task, you should examine
the discussion of this data set, including its visualization from 1970 until
2019, from the [Residential Population in Crawford County,
PA](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/PACRAW0POP) from the [Federal Reserve
Bank of St. Louis](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/). The main goal for this program
is that it should summarize the population data for Crawford County, the county
in which Allegheny College is located. Here is an excerpt from the
`input/data.txt` file that contains the real-world population data values that
the `dataanalysis` program must summarize:

```
1970-01-01,81.342
1971-01-01,83.300
1972-01-01,84.700
1973-01-01,85.500
1974-01-01,86.100
1975-01-01,87.000
1976-01-01,87.600
1977-01-01,87.600
1978-01-01,88.000
1979-01-01,88.100
1980-01-01,88.869
```

As this example indicates, the numbers in this file are either strings, that
should be interpreted as a date, or a floating-point value, that is a recording
of a population estimate of people living in Crawford County. After you have
studied and understood the structure of this file's contents, you are ready to
install the project's dependencies with the command `poetry install` and then
run it with the command `poetry run dataanalysis --data-file input/data.txt`.
After you running the program you can use its output and the data visualization
available from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis to better understand the
population trends for Crawford County. Finally, it is worth noting that the
numerical output from the `dataanalysis` program contains four properly indented
floating-point values that are always rounded to two decimal places.

```
ðŸ“¦ The data file contains 50 data values in it!

ðŸš€ Let's do some sophisticated data analysis!

ðŸ§® Here are the results of the data analysis:

    The computed mean is 87.80!
    The computed median is 88.05!

    The computed variance is 3.69!
    The computed standard deviation is 1.92!

ðŸ’¡ What does this tell you about the population of this city?
```

???+ note

    Don't forget that if you want to run the `dataanalysis` you must use your
    terminal to first go into the GitHub repository containing this project and
    then go into the `dataanalysis` directory that contains the project's code.
    Finally, remember that before running the program you must run `poetry
    install` to add the dependencies.

## Adding Functionality

If you study the file `dataanalysis/dataanalysis/main.py` you will see that it
has many `TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you need to
implement before `dataanalysis` will produce the correct output. If you run the
provided test suite with the command `poetry run task test` or you try to run
the program with the command `poetry run dataanalysis --data-file
input/data.txt` you will see an error message in your terminal window. This is
due to the fact that there are key parts of this program that are missing! In
addition to implementing the program's `main` function you also need to
correctly `import` the correct modules and objects, like `typer`. Along with
adding command-line features to the `main` function in the `main` module, you
need to provide an implementation of the following functions:

- `def compute_mean(numbers: List[float]) -> float`
- `def compute_median(numbers: List[float]) -> float`
- `def compute_difference(numbers: List[float]) -> List[float]`
- `def compute_variance(numbers: List[float]) -> float`
- `def compute_standard_deviation(numbers: List[float]) -> float`

It is worth noting that, when appropriate, one of the aforementioned functions
can call another function. For instance, the `compute_standard_deviation` can
call the `compute_variance`, thereby reusing its code and avoiding unnecessary
code duplication. In summary, you must follow all of the instructions next to
the `TODO` markers in the provided source code to implement a program that can
correctly compute the arithmetic mean of the provided data values in the
`dataanalysis/input/data.txt` file. In addition to ensuring that your program is
adequately documented, has the correct industry-standard format, and adheres to
the industry best practices Python programming, you must implement functions
that pass a provided Pytest test suite.

If you look in the files called `test_transform.py` and `test_summarize.py` you
will find the test suites for the `transform` and `summarize` modules. As you
complete your implementation of `dataanalysis` you should repeatedly run these
tests, as explained in the next subsection, to confirm that your program's
functions are working correctly. Your program should both produce the correct
output and the pass the test suite!

## Running Checks

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that it
includes the following section section of tasks that use
[taskipy](https://github.com/illBeRoy/taskipy):

```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
black = { cmd = "black dataanalysis tests --check", help = "Run the black checks for source code format" }
flake8 = { cmd = "flake8 dataanalysis tests", help = "Run the flake8 checks for source code documentation" }
mypy = { cmd = "poetry run mypy dataanalysis", help = "Run the mypy type checker for potential type errors" }
pydocstyle = { cmd = "pydocstyle dataanalysis tests", help = "Run the pydocstyle checks for source code documentation" }
pylint = { cmd = "pylint dataanalysis tests", help = "Run the pylint checks for source code documentation" }
test = { cmd = "pytest -x -s", help = "Run the pytest test suite" }
test-silent = { cmd = "pytest -x --show-capture=no", help = "Run the pytest test suite without showing output" }
all = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint && task mypy && task test"
lint = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint"
```

This section makes it easy to run commands like `poetry run task lint` to
automatically run all of the linters designed to check the Python source code in
your program and its test suite. You can also use the command `poetry run task
black` to confirm that your source code adheres to the industry-standard format
defined by the `black` tool. If it does not adhere to the standard then you can
run the command `poetry run black dataanalysis tests` and it will automatically
reformat the source code.

Along with running tasks like `poetry run task list`, you can leverage the
relevant instructions in the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) to enter into a Docker
container and run the command `gradle grade` to check your work. If `gradle
grade` shows that all checks pass, you will know that you made progress towards
correctly implementing and writing about `dataanalysis`. If your program has
all of the anticipated functionality, you can run the command `poetry run task
test` and see that the test suite produces output like the following. It is
important to note that `dataanalysis` comes with two test suites, both of
which should pass so as to establish a confidence in the correctness of the
program.

???+ note

    Don't forget that when you commit source code or technical writing to your
    GitHub repository for this project, it will trigger the run of a GitHub
    Actions workflow. If you are a student at Allegheny College, then running
    this workflow consumes build minutes for the course's organization! As such,
    you should only commit to your repository once you have made substantive
    changes to your project and you are ready to confirm its correctness. Before
    you commit to your repository, you can still run checks on your own computer
    by either using Poetry or Docker and GatorGrader.

## Project Reflection

Once you have finished both of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented, and answer all of the other questions about your experiences in
completing this project. The reflection's objective is to invite you to explain
the Python functions for data summarization and transformation. As part of this
project's reflection you should also consider what technical skills taught in
the field of computer science will continue to be the most relevant in the
future.

## Project Assessment
