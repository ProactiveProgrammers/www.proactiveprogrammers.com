### Course Meeting Schedule

- Discussion and Group Work Session: Monday and Wednesday, 11:30 am-12:20 pm

- Laboratory Session: Wednesday, 3:00 pm-4:50 pm

### Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on
understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects.
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students
learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create
and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also
learn how to write, organize, and document a program's source code so that it
is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds. During a weekly
laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved
laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during
class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Required Textbook

  Math Featuring Python](https://www.nmt.edu/press/stavely-2.php) by [Allan M.
  Stavely](https://www.nmt.edu/press/stavely-2.php)
- [Doing Math with Python](https://nostarch.com/doingmathwithpython) by [Amit

### Course Policies

#### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the
assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category               | Percentage |
|------------------------| -----------|
| Technical Assessments  |  10%       |
| Midterm Examination    |  10%       |
| Final Examination      |  10%       |
| Source Code Surveys    |  20%       |
| Programming Projects   |  20%       |
| Engineering Efforts    |  30%       |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Technical Assessments**: These cumulative weekly online assessments will
    cover all course content introduced to date. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to use their
    computer to take these technical assessments on the scheduled day.

-   **Midterm Examination**: The midterm is an online cumulative assessment
    covering all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to use their
    computer to take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in
    the stated period of time.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is an online cumulative assessment covering
    all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory sessions, as
    outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are made with the
    course instructor, all students will be expected to use their computer to
    take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in the stated
    period of time.

-   **Source Code Surveys**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook and the content covered during that day's in-person
    classroom session, technical challenges have the following goals: (i) help a
    learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by recalling
    facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the textbook
    and (ii) allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas
    by translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented
    in the textbook.

-   **Programming Projects**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook, the content covered during that week's in-person
    classroom session, and the weekly technical challenges, the practical
    assignments further equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of
    discrete structures by applying --- in a new way --- their knowledge of the
    facts, techniques, and rules of discrete mathematics and rigorous Python
    programming.

-   **Engineering Efforts**: These assignments invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments will invite
    students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern
    Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right
    balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization.
    Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to
    evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for
    instance, its efficiency and correctness.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and Google Calendar. Electronic versions of the engineering efforts,
programming projects, and source code surveys must be submitted to the
instructor through a student's GitHub repository. No credit will be awarded for
any course work that is not submitted to your GitHub repository with the
required name. Unless special arrangements are made with the instructor, no work
will be accepted after the published deadline.
