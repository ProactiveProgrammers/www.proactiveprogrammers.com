### Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on
understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects.
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students
learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create
and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also
learn how to write, organize, and document a program's source code so that it
is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds. During a weekly
laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved
laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during
class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Course Policies

#### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the
assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category               | Percentage |
|------------------------| -----------|
| Course Participation   |  5%        |
| Midterm Examination    |  10%       |
| Final Examination      |  15%       |
| Source Code Surveys    |  15%       |
| Programming Projects   |  15%       |
| Engineering Efforts    |  40%       |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Course Participation**: After either an unexcused absence or a late
    attendance to class on two separate occasions, a student's course
    participation grade will be reduced by half a percentage for each additional
    time they are absent or late in an unexcused fashion. Students who need to
    miss class or attend late for an excused reason should communicate their
    situation to the course instructor as soon as possible.

-   **Midterm Examinations**: The midterms are online cumulative assessments
    covering all prior material from the class, programming, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the course schedule. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the instructor, all students should use their computer to take
    this test on the scheduled date and to complete it in the stated location
    while taking no more than the required amount of time. Each midterm is an
    executable examination that a student will complete through the use of
    GitHub, VS Code, and the programming tools installed on their laptops.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is an online cumulative assessment
    covering all of the material from the class, programming, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to use their
    computer to take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in
    the stated period of time.

-   **Source Code Surveys**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook and the content covered during that day's in-person
    classroom session, technical challenges have the following goals: (i) help a
    learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by recalling
    facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the textbook
    and (ii) allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas
    by translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented
    in the textbook.

-   **Programming Projects**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook, the content covered during that week's in-person
    classroom session, and the weekly technical challenges, the programming
    projects further equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of
    discrete structures by applying &mdash; in a new way &mdash; their
    knowledge of the facts, techniques, and rules of discrete mathematics and
    rigorous Python programming.

-   **Engineering Efforts**: These assignments invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments will invite
    students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern
    Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right
    balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization.
    Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to
    evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for
    instance, its efficiency and correctness.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and Google Calendar. Electronic versions of the engineering efforts,
programming projects, and source code surveys must be submitted to the
instructor through a student's GitHub repository. No credit will be awarded for
any course work that is not submitted to your GitHub repository with the
required name. Unless special arrangements are made with the instructor, no work
will be accepted after the published deadline. Unless there is documentation for
an extenuating circumstance that warrants extra time, the course instructor will
disable a student's ability to push to the GitHub repository for a course
assignment two days after the project is due.

#### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your assignment's
GitHub repository, you will privately receive a grade for and feedback on each
assignment. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed
correct work that fulfills the project's specification and submitted it by the
deadline.

#### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the course sessions. If, due to
extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one day in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions.

#### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class discussions, laboratory, and programming sessions.
During the class periods, the course instructor will often pose challenging
questions that could require group discussion, the creation of a Python program
or data table, a vote on a thought-provoking issue, or an in-class
presentation. Only those students who have prepared for class by reading the
assigned material and reviewing the current course assignments will be able to
effectively participate in these class discussions.

Importantly, only prepared students will be able to acquire the knowledge and
skills that they need to be successful in this course, subsequent courses, and
the field of web development. In order to help students remain organized and to
effectively prepare for classes, the course instructor will maintain a class
schedule with reading assignments and presentation slides, available at on this
site. During the class sessions students will also be required to download, use,
and modify web site components and data sets that are made available through
means such as the course web site and a GitHub repository.

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
either a class, laboratory, or programming session are encouraged to seek
assistance from the course instructor and the student technical leaders.
Students should, within the bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions
on the Slack workspace for our course; please request assistance from the
instructor and student technical leaders first through Slack before sending an
email. Students who need the course instructor's assistance must schedule a
meeting through his web site and come to the virtual meeting with all of the
details needed to discuss their question. Students can find out the office hour
schedule student technical leaders by viewing the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Using GitHub and Discord

This course will primarily use GitHub and Discord for all course communication,
as summarized in the list of [community
connections](/proactive-community/community-connections). We will use GitHub for
the sharing of both source code and course projects and for reporting issues in
those materials. We will use two distinct Discord servers for all course
discussions. The [Proactive Programmers Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR) provides a way for members of the
proactive community to use text and video to chat with each other and will be
the main forum for the discussion of technical content in discrete structures.
The [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
Server](https://discord.gg/CS2h9kXzX6) provides a way for students who are
studying computer science at Allegheny College to use text and video to chat
with each other and will be the main forum for course announcements.

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use GitHub and Discord for class communication, the
course instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The Honor
Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit or to meet
non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College. This includes all
work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and course assignments). All
students who have enrolled in the College will work under the Honor Program.
Each student who has matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following
pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

#### Effective Collaboration

Computer science is an inherently collaborative discipline. People must work
together to produce large, complex, and ultimately useful software systems.
Because of this, the Department of Computer Science at Allegheny College
encourages students to engage in collaboration. However, in the context of
individual coursework, through which each student must demonstrate their own
knowledge, there are certain forms of collaboration that are and are not
acceptable.

- Acceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Discussing high-level concepts, such as the use cases for `while` loops
      or the various methods that can add elements to a `list`.
    - Referring someone to a course text book, course slides, or other
      resources that contain helpful information or instructions.
    - Outlining the high-level steps to solving a problem or implementing a
      feature, without mentioning specific lines of code that need to be
      written.

- Unacceptable forms of collaboration include:
    - Sharing details about specific lines of code, including showing your
      source code to someone or looking at someone else's code.
    - Copying someone else's source code, technical writing, or program output,
      even with some slight modifications.
    - Typing source code, technical writing, or program commands on someone
      else’s laptop or computer.

The aforementioned forms of communication are unacceptable because they make it
difficult for both the course instructor and a learner to assess individual
knowledge. Moreover, these unacceptable forms of collaboration can impede your
learning or someone else's learning since an individual is less likely to
understand source code or technical writing that you do not create by themself.
Importantly, any student who participates in these unacceptable forms of
collaboration, whether they are the one sharing, showing, looking, copying, or
typing, are in violation of the Honor Code at Allegheny College.

In summary, students should collaborate as long as they do so in acceptable
ways. With that said, if a student needs assistance beyond what can be gained
through acceptable forms of collaboration, they should seek help from the
course instructor or a technical leader. If a student submits deliverables
(e.g., source code or technical writing) that are nearly identical to the work
of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

#### Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 814-332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons
and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to
ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

### Welcome Message

Referring to software, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. wrote in chapter one of *The
Mythical Man Month*, "The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time."
Efficient Python programs that correctly use discrete structures to store and
manipulate data have the potential to positively influence the lives of many
people. Moreover, the design, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of
Python-based software are exciting and rewarding activities! At the start of
this class, I invite you to pursue, with great enthusiasm and vigor, this
adventure in rigorous Python programming.
