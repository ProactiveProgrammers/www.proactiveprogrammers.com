### Course Description

An introduction to the foundations of computer science with an emphasis on
understanding the abstract structures used to represent discrete objects.
Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students
learn the computational methods and logical principles that they need to create
and manipulate discrete objects in a programming environment. Students also
learn how to write, organize, and document a program's source code so that it
is easily accessible to intended users of varied backgrounds. During a weekly
laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete
projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral
presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved
laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during
class and lab sessions. Prerequisite: Knowledge of elementary algebra.

- Prerequisite: CMPSC 100 or permission of the instructor.
- Distribution Requirements: QR, SP.

### Course Policies

#### Grading

The grade that a student receives in this class will be based on the following
categories. All of these percentages are approximate and, if the need to do so
presents itself, it is possible for the course instructor to change the
assigned percentages during the academic semester.

| Category               | Percentage |
|------------------------| -----------|
| Technical Assessments  |  10%       |
| Midterm Examination    |  10%       |
| Final Examination      |  10%       |
| Source Code Surveys    |  20%       |
| Programming Projects   |  20%       |
| Engineering Efforts    |  30%       |

These grading categories have the following definitions:

-   **Technical Assessments**: These cumulative weekly online assessments will
    cover all course content introduced to date. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to use their
    computer to take these technical assessments on the scheduled day.

-   **Midterm Examination**: The midterm is an online cumulative assessment
    covering all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory
    sessions, as outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are
    made with the course instructor, all students will be expected to use their
    computer to take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in
    the stated period of time.

-   **Final Examination**: The final is an online cumulative assessment covering
    all of the material from the class, practical, and laboratory sessions, as
    outlined on the review sheet. Unless prior arrangements are made with the
    course instructor, all students will be expected to use their computer to
    take this test on the scheduled date and complete the test in the stated
    period of time.

-   **Source Code Surveys**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook and the content covered during that day's in-person
    classroom session, technical challenges have the following goals: (i) help a
    learner to demonstrate that they can remember learned material by recalling
    facts, basic concepts, and answers to questions presented in the textbook
    and (ii) allow a learner to demonstrate an understanding of facts and ideas
    by translating, interpreting, and stating the main technical ideas presented
    in the textbook.

-   **Programming Projects**: Graded on a checkmark basis and building on
    material in the textbook, the content covered during that week's in-person
    classroom session, and the weekly technical challenges, the practical
    assignments further equip a learner to solve new problems in the field of
    discrete structures by applying --- in a new way --- their knowledge of the
    facts, techniques, and rules of discrete mathematics and rigorous Python
    programming.

-   **Engineering Efforts**: These assignments invite students to explore
    different techniques for rigorously designing, implementing, evaluating, and
    documenting real-world Python programs. These assignments will invite
    students to use tools like a text editor, a terminal window, and a modern
    Python development environment to implement functions that strike the right
    balance between understandability, generalizability, and specialization.
    Students will also use the data collected from running experiments to
    evaluate the implementation of a Python function as they consider, for
    instance, its efficiency and correctness.

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments will have a stated due date shared through GitHub, GitHub
Classroom, and Google Calendar. Electronic versions of the engineering efforts,
programming projects, and source code surveys must be submitted to the
instructor through a student's GitHub repository. No credit will be awarded for
any course work that is not submitted to your GitHub repository with the
required name. Unless special arrangements are made with the instructor, no work
will be accepted after the published deadline.

#### Assignment Evaluation

Using a report that the instructor shares with you through your assignment's
GitHub repository, you will privately receive a grade for and feedback on each
assignment. Your grade will be a function of whether or not you completed
correct work that fulfills the project's specification and submitted it by the
deadline.

#### Course Attendance

It is mandatory for all students to attend the assigned course sessions. If, due
to extenuating circumstances, you will not be able to attend a session, then,
whenever possible, please communicate with the instructor at least one week in
advance to describe your situation. Students who have any signs of illness
should not attend any in-person course sessions.

#### Class Preparation

In order to minimize confusion and maximize learning, students must invest time
to prepare for the class discussions, laboratory, and programming sessions.
During the class periods, the course instructor will often pose challenging
questions that could require group discussion, the creation of a Python program
or data table, a vote on a thought-provoking issue, or an in-class presentation.
Only those students who have prepared for class by reading the assigned material
and reviewing the current laboratory and practical assignments will be able to
effectively participate in these class discussions.

Importantly, only prepared students will be able to acquire the knowledge and
skills that they need to be successful in this course, subsequent courses, and
the field of web development. In order to help students remain organized and to
effectively prepare for classes, the course instructor will maintain a class
schedule with reading assignments and presentation slides, available at on this
site. During the class sessions students will also be required to download, use,
and modify web site components and data sets that are made available through
means such as the course web site and a GitHub repository.

#### Seeking Assistance

Students who are struggling to understand the knowledge and skills developed in
either a class, laboratory, or practical session are encouraged to seek
assistance from the course instructor and the student technical leaders.
Students should, within the bounds of the Honor Code, ask and answer questions
on the Slack workspace for our course; please request assistance from the
instructor and student technical leaders first through Slack before sending an
email. Students who need the course instructor's assistance must schedule a
meeting through his web site and come to the virtual meeting with all of the
details needed to discuss their question. Students can find out the office hour
schedule student technical leaders by viewing the list of [student technical
leaders](https://www.cs.allegheny.edu/teaching/technicalleaders/).

#### Using Email

Although we will primarily use Discord for class communication, the course
instructor will sometimes use email to send announcements about important
matters such as changes in the schedule. It is your responsibility to check your
email at least once a day and to ensure that you can reliably send and receive
emails. This class policy is based on the statement about the use of email that
appears in *The Compass*, the College's student handbook; please see the
instructor if you do not have this handbook.

#### Honor Code

The Academic Honor Program that governs the entire academic program at
Allegheny College is described in the Allegheny Academic Bulletin. The
Honor Program applies to all work that is submitted for academic credit
or to meet non-credit requirements for graduation at Allegheny College.
This includes all work assigned for this class (e.g., examinations and
practical and laboratory assignments). All students who have enrolled in
the College will work under the Honor Program. Each student who has
matriculated at the College has acknowledged the following pledge:

> I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as
> defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both
> myself and the College community as a whole.

It is understood that an important part of the learning process in any
course, and particularly one in computer science, derives from
thoughtful discussions with teachers and fellow students. Such dialogue
is encouraged. However, it is necessary to distinguish carefully between
the student who discusses the principles underlying a problem with
others and the student who produces assignments that are identical to,
or merely variations on, someone else's work. While it is acceptable for
students in this class to discuss their source code, images, and reports
with their classmates, deliverables that are nearly identical to the
work of others will be taken as evidence of violating the Honor Code.

#### Disability Services

The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination
statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with
disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires all students with
disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable
accommodation of their disabilities. Students with disabilities who believe they
may need accommodations in this class are encouraged to contact Disability
Services at 814-332-2898. Disability Services is part of the Learning Commons
and is located in Pelletier Library. Please do this as soon as possible to
ensure that approved accommodations are implemented in a timely fashion.

### Welcome Message

In reference to software, Frederick P. Brooks, Jr. wrote in chapter one of *The
Mythical Man Month* that "the magic of myth and legend has come true in our
time." It is so exciting that we can write programs that "come alive" on our
computers! Moreover, efficient Python programs that correctly use store and
manipulate data have the potential to positively influence the lives of many
people. Moreover, the design, implementation, evaluation, and documentation of
Python-based software are exciting and rewarding activities! The course
instructor invites you to pursue, with great enthusiasm and vigor, this
adventure in rigorous Python programming.
