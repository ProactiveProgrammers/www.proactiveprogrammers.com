# Learning Objectives

A proactive programmer studying discrete structures should be able to
effectively demonstrate the mastery of the following learning objectives in the
categories of **mathematical communication** and **rigorous programming**.
According to , a learning objective must
be "a clear, measurable action that a student should be able to do once the
lesson is over".[^1] For the purposes of this site, these learning objectives
are not for a specific lesson but rather for an entire course for an Allegheny
College student or for the duration of self-paced learning for all other
emerging proactive programmers.

## Mathematical Communication

## Rigorous Programming

A person learning discrete structures with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following programming skills:

### Proficient Python Programming

  - Write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have the following
    characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has descriptive comments for module definition and both the function's
      declaration and the function's code that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), showing that it
      correctly implements the specification for the function.
    - Has an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard framework
      such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), that covers at least the 80%
      of the statements and branches in the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance in seconds or
      milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, and recursion in a way that passes the function's test suite, works
      efficiently, and conveys the intended function's purpose in a Pythonic
      fashion.
    - Correctly uses discrete structures such as numbers, tuples, sets, streams,
      and sequences in a way that passes the test suite, works efficiently, and
      conveys the intended purpose of the function in a Pythonic fashion.
  - Writes correct Python programs consisting of between one and five hundred
    lines of source code that correctly solve problems using the aforementioned
    discrete structures.

### Python Programming Tools

  - A learner will use a Python programming environment to complete these tasks
    while implementing a Python program consisting of between one and five
      hundred lines of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use the Python 3.8 interpreter to run a Python
      program.
    - Create a virtual environment with Poetry and use it to run a Python
      program without error in an isolated and self-contained setting.
    - Use Docker to run without error a program a Python program in an isolated
      container that can run the test suite and autograding tools.
    - Use testing to detect a failure in a Python program and then effectively
      use tools like a text editor and a terminal window to find and fix the
      failure, ultimately confirming that the Python programs no longer contains
      the failure and the fix did not compromise other functions in the program.
    - Use a text editor to participate in remote Python programming by
      effectively completing the following tasks:
      - Creating and accepting an invitation to collaboratively implement a
        Python program.
      - Collaboratively sharing a terminal window with a remote developer.
      - Running a Python program that starts a server and then sharing the
        access to that server with a remote developer.

### Using Version Control

  - A learner will use the GitHub version control system in the following
    fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
      an extension for Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
      repository.
    - Use GitHub pre-commit hooks to ensure that all of the source code,
      technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the industry standards
      for content and format.
    - Navigate reports produced by GitHub Actions so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do not adhere to a project's specification.
    - Use the GitHub Flow model to implement specific features in a branch of a
      GitHub repository and then merge that branch to the main one only after
      all the checks run by GitHub Actions pass as required.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the GitHub issue tracker, furnishing descriptive issue titles and
      descriptions that adhere to industry best practices.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by GitHub Actions.

## Improving Objectives

As [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/) explains, a learning objective is
**clear** when it is "clear from the students' perspective" and **measurable**
when there is "some way to know whether the objective has been met" or "how far
away the learning is from meeting it". Do you see a way in which we can improve
the learning objectives for discrete structures? If you do, then please
participate in the [proactive
community](../../../proactive-community/community-connections/)
by sharing your ideas for improving them!

  Write Learning
  Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
  details about how to design learning objectives for a academic course. From
  your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
  clear and measurable?
