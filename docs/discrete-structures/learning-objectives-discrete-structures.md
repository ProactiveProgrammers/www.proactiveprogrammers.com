# Learning Objectives

A proactive programmer studying discrete structures should be able to
effectively demonstrate the mastery of the following learning objectives in the
categories of **mathematical communication** and **rigorous programming**.
According to [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/), a learning objective must
be "a clear, measurable action that a student should be able to do once the
lesson is over".[^1] For the purposes of this site, these learning objectives
are not for a specific lesson but rather an entire course for an Allegheny
College student or for the duration of self-paced learning for all other
emerging proactive programmers.

## Mathematical Communication

## Rigorous Programming

A person learning discrete structures with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following programming skills:

### Proficient Python Programming

  - Write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have the following
    characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has descriptive comments for module definition and both the function's
      declaration and the function's code that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), showing that it
      correctly implements the specification for the function.
    - Has an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard framework
      such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), that covers at least the 80%
      of the statements and branches in the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance in seconds or
      milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose in a Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly uses discrete structure variables such as numbers, tuples, sets,
      streams, and sequences in a way that passes the test suite, works
      efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose of the function in a
      Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly performs calculations for statistical properties of a data set
      (e.g., the mean, median, and standard deviation), while also clearly
      displaying the data, its relevant summarization values, and the
      interpretation of all statistical properties.
  - Writes correct Python programs consisting of between one and five hundred
    lines of source code that correctly solve problems using the aforementioned
    discrete structures.

### Python Programming Tools

  - Use a Python programming environment to complete these tasks
    while implementing a Python program consisting of between one and five
      hundred lines of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8 or 3.9
      programming environment to create, run, and debug a Python program through
      a terminal window and/or a text editor.
    - Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install a Python program's
      dependencies, create a virtual environment, and run a it without error in
      an isolated and self-contained setting.
    - Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run, in an isolated container and
      without error, a Python program, an automated test suite, and automated
      grading tools such as
      [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
    - Use and create a test suite implemented with
      [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to detect a failure in a Python program
      and then effectively use tools like a text editor and a terminal window to
      find and fix the failure, ultimately confirming that the Python program no
      longer contains the failure and that the fix did not compromise other
      functions in the program.
    - Use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to
      participate in a remote and collaborative Python programming session by
      effectively completing the following tasks:
        - Creating and accepting an invitation to collaboratively create a
          Python program.
        - Collaboratively sharing a terminal window with a remote developer.
        - While using text-based chat and/or video communication,
          collaboratively a feature and repair a defect in a Python program.

### Using Version Control

  - Use the [GitHub](https://github.com/) platform and the
    [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system in the following fashion:
    - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
      an extension for Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
    - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
      in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
      repository.
    - Use GitHub [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that all
      of the source code, technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the
      industry standards for content and format.
    - Navigate reports produced by [GitHub
      Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so as to determine which
      aspects of a GitHub repository do and do not adhere to a project's
      specification.
    - Use the [GitHub Flow model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
      to implement specific features in a branch of a GitHub repository and then
      merge that branch to the main one only after all the checks run by GitHub
      Actions pass as required and code reviews confirms the code's correctness.
    - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
      use of the [GitHub Issue
      Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues)
      and the [GitHub Discussion
      Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions),
      furnishing descriptive titles and problem descriptions that adhere to
      industry best practices and project templates.
    - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
      industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
      build by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).

## Improving Objectives

As [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/) explains, a learning objective is
**clear** when it is "clear from the students' perspective" and **measurable**
when there is "some way to know whether the objective has been met" or "how far
away the learning is from meeting it". Do you see a way in which we can improve
the learning objectives for discrete structures? If you do, then please
participate in the [proactive
community](../../../proactive-community/community-connections/)
by sharing your ideas for improving them!

  Write Learning
  Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
  details about how to design learning objectives for a academic course. From
  your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
  clear and measurable?
