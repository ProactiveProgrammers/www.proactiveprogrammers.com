# Learning Objectives

A proactive programmer studying discrete structures should be able to
effectively demonstrate the mastery of the following learning objectives in the
categories of **mathematical communication** and **rigorous programming**.
According to , a learning objective must
be "a clear, measurable action that a student should be able to do once the
lesson is over".[^1] For the purposes of this site, these learning objectives
are not for a specific lesson but rather for an entire course for an Allegheny
College student or for the duration of self-paced learning for all other
emerging proactive programmers.

## Mathematical Communication



## Rigorous Programming

## Improving Objectives

As [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/) explains, a learning objective is
**clear** when it is "clear from the students' perspective" and **measurable**
when there is "some way to know whether the objective has been met" or "how far
away the learning is from meeting it". Do you see a way in which we can improve
the learning objectives for discrete structures? If you do, then please
participate in the [proactive
community](../../../proactive-community/community-connections/)
by sharing your ideas for improving them!

  Write Learning
  Objectives](https://rtalbert.org/how-to-write-learning-objectives/) for more
  details about how to design learning objectives for a academic course. From
  your perspective what does it mean to write learning objectives that are both
  clear and measurable?
