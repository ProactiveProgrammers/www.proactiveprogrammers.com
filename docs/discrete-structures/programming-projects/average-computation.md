# Computing Averages

## Project Goals

This programming project invites you to combine what you learned about the
basics of Python programming to implement a useful program that computes the
average of all of the numbers in a file that is provided as input to a program.
The program will input the numerical values in a file, iterate through them,
and return the average (i.e., arithmetic mean) of all the values. Along with
adding documentation to the provided source code, you will create your own
Python functions that use both iteration constructs and conditional logic to
implement a correct program that passes the test suite and all checks. As you
enhance your [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/), you will program
with tools such as VS Code and a terminal window and the Python programming
language and the Poetry package manager.

## Project Access

If you are a student enrolled in a Computer Science class at Allegheny College,
you can access this assignment by clicking the link provided to you in Discord.
Once you click this link it will create a GitHub repository that you can clone
to your computer by following the general-purpose instructions in the
description of the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/). Specifically, you
will need to use the `git clone` command to download the project from GitHub to
your computer. Now you are ready to add source code and documentation to the
project!

## Expected Output

This project invites you to implement a program called `average` that performs
arithmetic. The program accepts through its command-line a file that contains
integer values encoded as text. If you run the program with the command `poetry
run average --dir input --file numbers.txt` it produces this output:

```
ðŸ˜ƒ Computing the average of numbers in a file called input/numbers.txt!

ðŸ˜‰ Phew, that was hard work!

âœ¨ The average of the input values is -0.95
```

Although this example shows the `average` program performing its computation
with the `numbers.txt` file in the `input` directory, it should work in a
general-purpose fashion for any text file that contains integer numbers aligned
in a single row like:

```
-19
-24
-81
12
16
```

To learn more about how to run this program, you can type the command `poetry
run average --help` to see the following output showing how to use `average`:

```shell
Usage: average [OPTIONS]

  Process a file by computing the average of all the numbers.

Options:
  --dir PATH
  --file PATH
  --install-completion  Install completion for the current shell.
  --show-completion     Show completion for the current shell, to copy it
                        or customize the installation.

  --help                Show this message and exit.
```

Please note that the provided source code does not contain all of the
functionality to produce this output. As explained in the next section, you
should add all of the missing features to ensure that `average` produces the
expected output. Once the program is working correctly, it should produce all of
the expected output described in this section.

???+ note

    Don't forget that if you want to run the `average` program you must use your
    terminal window to first go into the GitHub repository containing this
    project and then go into the `average` directory that contains the project's
    source code. Finally, remember that before running the program you must run
    `poetry install` to add the dependencies.

## Adding Functionality

If you study the file `average/average/main.py` you will see that it has many
`TODO` markers that designate the parts of the program that you need to
implement before `average` will produce correct output. If you run the provided
test suite with the command `poetry run task test` you will see that it produces
output like the following:

```
    def test_average_computation_five_numbers():
        """Confirm that it is possible to average together five non-zero numbers."""
        number_list = """-72
            29
            61
            -42
            44"""
        average_value = main.compute_average(number_list)
>       assert average_value == ((-72 + 29 + 61 + -42 + 44) / 5)
E       assert 0 == (((((-72 + 29) + 61) + -42) + 44) / 5)
```

Note that this test case fails because of the fact that, by default, the
`compute_average` function returns `0` instead of the correct arithmetic mean of
the numbers specified in the `number_list` variable. You will need to add source
code to the `compute_average` function so that it correctly calculates the
average of the input values!

In summary, you should implement the following functions for the `average`
program:

- `def compute_average(contents: str) -> float:`
- `def average(dir: Path = typer.Option(None), file: Path = typer.Option(None)) -> None:`

It is worth noting that the `compute_average` function accepts as input a `str`
that is a one-number-per-line encoding of the file that contains the integer
numbers. This means that `compute_average` will need to iterate through each
line in the file and convert the text-based encoding of the number to an `int`.
The `compute_average` function should also handle the circumstance in which the
user-provided file (i.e., `numbers.txt`) does not have any numbers inside of it!
If there were no numbers in the file, then the function can return `-1` to
indicate that it did not compute an average. As you are finishing your
implementation of the `compute_average` function, you should also ensure that,
if all of the numbers inside of the file are `0`, then it returns an average of `0`.

## Running Checks

If you study the source code in the `pyproject.toml` file you will see that
it includes the following section that specifies different executable tasks:

```toml
[tool.taskipy.tasks]
black = { cmd = "black average tests --check", help = "Run the black checks for source code format" }
flake8 = { cmd = "flake8 average tests", help = "Run the flake8 checks for source code documentation" }
mypy = { cmd = "poetry run mypy average", help = "Run the mypy type checker for potential type errors" }
pydocstyle = { cmd = "pydocstyle average tests", help = "Run the pydocstyle checks for source code documentation" }
pylint = { cmd = "pylint average tests", help = "Run the pylint checks for source code documentation" }
test = { cmd = "pytest -x -s", help = "Run the pytest test suite" }
test-silent = { cmd = "pytest -x --show-capture=no", help = "Run the pytest test suite without showing output" }
all = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint && task mypy && task test"
lint = "task black && task flake8 && task pydocstyle && task pylint"
```

This section makes it easy to run commands like `poetry run task lint` to
automatically run all of the linters designed to check the Python source code in
your program and its test suite. You can also use the command `poetry run task
black` to confirm that your source code adheres to the industry-standard format
defined by the `black` tool. If it does not adhere to the standard then you can
run the command `poetry run black average tests` and it will automatically
reformat the source code.

Along with running tasks like `poetry run task lint`, you can leverage the
relevant instructions in the [technical
skills](/proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) to enter into a Docker
container and run `gradle grade` to check your work. If `gradle grade` shows
that all checks pass, you will know that you made progress towards correctly
implementing and writing about `average`.

If your program has all of the anticipated functionality, you can run the
command `poetry run task test` and see that the test suite produces output like
this:

```shell
collected 5 items

tests/test_average.py .....
```

You will know that the `compute_average` function correctly returns `0` when all
of the inputs are `0` if the following test case passes:

```python linenums="1"
def test_average_computation_five_numbers_all_zero():
    """Confirm that it is possible to average together five zero numbers."""
    number_list = """0
        0
        0
        0
        0"""
    average_value = main.compute_average(number_list)
    assert average_value == 0
```

Lines `3` through `7` of this test case define the `number_list` variable as one
that contains a list of `0` values separated by newlines. The purpose of
`number_list` is to represent the string that would arrive from the input file
if a person ran the `average` program on the command-line. Line `8` of this test
case calls the `compute_average` function with the `number_list` as the input
and stores the output in a variable called `average_value`. Finally, line `9`
confirms that `compute_average` calculates the average of the input as `0`.

You will know that the `compute_average` function correctly returns `-1` when
there is no input to the function if the follow test case passes:

```python linenums="1"
def test_average_computation_no_provided_numbers():
    """Confirm that it is possible to average together no numbers."""
    number_list = ""
    average_value = main.compute_average(number_list)
    assert average_value == -1
```

On line `3` in the above source code, this test defines `number_list` as an
empty string, denoted by `""`. Finally, on line `4` it calls the
`compute_average` function with `number_list` as its input and on line `5` it
confirms that the computed `average_value` is `-1`, as required by the
specification of the function under test.

Once all of the test cases pass, you can run the all of the automated checks by
typing `poetry run task all` in your terminal and confirming that there are no
errors in the output. If all of the checks pass, then you can run the program
with the command `poetry run average --dir input --file numbers.txt` and then
confirm that it produces the expected output, including the average of `-0.95`.

???+ note

    Don't forget that when you commit source code or technical writing to your
    GitHub repository for this project, it will trigger the run of a GitHub
    Actions workflow. If you are a student at Allegheny College, then running
    this workflow consumes build minutes for the course's organization! As such,
    you should only commit to your repository once you have made substantive
    changes to your project and you are ready to confirm its correctness. Before
    you commit to your repository, you can still run checks on your own computer
    by either using Poetry or Docker and GatorGrader.

## Project Reflection

Once you have finished all of the previous technical tasks, you can use a text
editor to answer all of the questions in the `writing/reflection.md` file. For
instance, you should provide the output of the Python program in a fenced code
block, explain the meaning of the Python source code segments that you
implemented and tested, compare and contrast different implementations of the
Python function called `compute_average`, and answer all of the other questions
about your experiences in completing this project. One specific goal for this
reflection is to ensure that you understand how to accept as input the textual
representation of a list of numbers, convert that to a list of numerical values,
and then perform an average computation on those values.
