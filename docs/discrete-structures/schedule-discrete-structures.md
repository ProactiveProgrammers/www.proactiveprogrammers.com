# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Technical Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore discrete structures with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the list of [proactive
  technical skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).

## Preliminary Connections

### Technical Question

- How do I connect mathematical notation and concepts (e.g., mapping, function,
  number, and set), to the implementation of useful Python programs that
  declare and call functions and declare variables and manipulate their values?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 1 of *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concept Review"

    - **Mapping**: set of ordered pairs in which no two first elements are the same
    - **Function**: a process that takes input, performs a computation, and produces output
    - **Variable**: a storage location in memory associated with both a value and a type
    - **Number**: a variable that stores numerical value with a minimum, maximum, and type
    - **Set**: an unordered collection of distinct objects

## Programming Constructs

### Technical Question

- How do I use iteration and conditional logic in a Python program to perform
  computational tasks like processing the contents of a file and mathematical
  tasks like using Newton's method to approximate the square root of a number?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Appendix B of *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concept Review"

    - **Assignment Statement**: an operation to store a value in a variable
    - **Iteration Construct**: a construct to support repeated execution of
      operations
    - **Conditional Logic**: a construct to support decision making in a program
    - **Quadratic Root**: value of a quadratic function where it intercepts the
      horizontal axis
    - **Square Root**: mathematical function that is the inverse of the square of a
      number

## Python Functions

### Technical Question

- How do I use non-recursive functions, recursive functions, and lambda
  expressions to perform mathematical operations such as computing the absolute
  value of a number and the mean and median of a sequence of numbers?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 4 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 3 of *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concept Review"

    - **Python Function**: subroutine or procedure that accepts input, performs
      steps, and produces output
    - **Recursive Function**: special type of Python function that makes a call
      to itself in its definition
    - **Lambda Expression**: an expression that accepts input, performs steps,
      and produces output
    - **Arithmetic Mean**: the average of a list of values calculated by summing
      the values and divide by the list's size
    - **Median Value**: for a list of values sorted in increasing order, the
      middle value in the list
