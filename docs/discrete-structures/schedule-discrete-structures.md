# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Key Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard [programming
  tools](../tools/programming-tools.md) that will help me to rigorously
  explore discrete structures with the Python programming language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and all tutorials referenced in the [proactive technical
  skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).

## Preliminary Connections

### Technical Question

- How do I connect mathematical notation and concepts (e.g., mapping, function,
  number, and set), to the implementation of useful Python programs that
  declare and call functions and declare and manipulate variables?

### Technical Concepts

- **Function**: an operation that takes input and produces output
- **Variable**: a storage location associated with a value and a type
- **Number**: a discrete numerical value with a minimum and maximum
- **Set**: an unordered collection of related objects

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 1 of *Doing Math with Python*

## Programming Constructs

### Key Question

- How do I use iteration and conditional logic in a Python program to perform
  computational tasks like processing the contents of a file and mathematical
  tasks like using Newton's method to approximate the square root of a number?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Appendix B of *Doing Math with Python*
