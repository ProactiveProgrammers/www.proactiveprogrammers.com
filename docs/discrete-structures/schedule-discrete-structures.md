# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Technical Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore discrete structures with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the list of [proactive
  technical skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).

## Making Connections

### Technical Question

- How do I connect mathematical notation and concepts (e.g., mapping, function,
  number, and set), to the implementation of useful Python programs that
  declare and call functions and declare variables and manipulate their values?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/discrete-structures/making-connections/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Mapping**: set of ordered pairs in which no two first elements are the same
    - **Function**: a process that takes input, performs a computation, and produces output
    - **Variable**: a storage location in memory associated with both a value and a type
    - **Number**: a variable that stores numerical value with a minimum, maximum, and type
    - **Set**: an unordered collection of distinct objects

## Programming Constructs

### Technical Question

- How do I use iteration and conditional logic in a Python program to perform
  computational tasks like processing the contents of a file and mathematical
  tasks like using Newton's method to approximate the square root of a number?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 1 and Appendix B of *Doing Math with Python*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/discrete-structures/programming-constructs/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Assignment Statement**: an operation to store a value in a variable
    - **Iteration Construct**: a structure to support the repeated execution of
      operations
    - **Conditional Logic**: a construct to support decision making in a
      program
    - **Quadratic Root**: value(s) of a quadratic function where it intercepts
      the horizontal axis
    - **Square Root**: mathematical function that is the inverse of the square
      of a number

## Python Functions

### Technical Question

- How do I use non-recursive functions, recursive functions, and lambda
  expressions to perform mathematical operations such as computing the absolute
  value of a number and the mean and median of a sequence of numbers?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 4 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 3 of *Doing Math with Python*
- Check out the [course slides](/slides/discrete-structures/python-functions/) for a detailed investigation of these chapters!

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Python Function**: subroutine or procedure that accepts input, performs
      steps, and produces output
    - **Recursive Function**: special type of Python function that makes a call
      to itself in its definition
    - **Lambda Expression**: an expression that accepts input, performs steps,
      and produces output
    - **Arithmetic Mean**: the average of a list of values calculated by summing
      the values and divide by the list's size
    - **Median Value**: for a list of values sorted in increasing order, the
      middle value in the list

## Data Containers

### Technical Question

- How do I use the mathematical concepts of ordered pairs, n-tuples, and lists
  to implement efficient Python programs that use functions with a clearly
  specified behavior to perform tasks like the input and parsing of a comma
  separated value file?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 5 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 2 of *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Ordered Pair**: grouping of two elements such that their order is
      important
    - **Tuple**: immutable ordered sequence that can contain elements of
      any type
    - **Delimiter**: a symbol that separates data values
    - **Flat File**: file that has no structure other than being divided into
      lines and fields
    - **CSV Format**: comma-separated value files that use a comma as a
      delimiter to separate data

## Monoids

### Technical Question

- How do I use the mathematical concepts of sequences, monoids, and lists to
  implement efficient Python programs that use functions with a clearly
  specified behavior to perform tasks like finding a name in a file or computing
  the arithmetic mean of data values?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 6 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 3 of *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Sequence**: a collection of ordered homogeneous elements such a strings
      and files
    - **n-Tuple**: a collection of ordered heterogeneous elements with a fixed
      number of components
    - **Concatenation**: the process of joining together the contents of two or
      more variables to form a new variable
    - **Monoid**: abstract discrete structure that describes the behavior of
      other structures in Python, including a string
    - **Map Function**: function that applies a one-argument function to every
      element of a sequence

## Data Streams

### Technical Question

- How do I use dynamically generated streams of data to implement memory
  efficient and predictable Python programs?

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 7 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- All previously assigned chapters in *Doing Math with Python*

???+ note "Technical Concepts"

    - **Ordered Pair**: grouping of two elements such that their order is
      important
    - **Tuple**: immutable ordered sequence that can contain elements of
      any type
    - **Delimiter**: a symbol that separates data values
    - **Flat File**: file that has no structure other than being divided into
      lines and fields
