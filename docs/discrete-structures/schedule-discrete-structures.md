# Course Schedule

## Software Operation

### Key Question

- How do I install and use the industry-standard programming tools that will
  help me to rigorously explore discrete structures with the Python programming
  language?

### Reading Assignments

- All written content in and tutorials referenced by the [proactive technical
  skills](/technical-skills/introduction-technical-skills).

## Preliminary Connections

### Technical Question

- How do I connect mathematical notation and concepts (e.g., mapping, function,
  number, and set), to the implementation of useful Python programs that
  declare and call functions and declare and manipulate variables?

### Technical Concepts

- **Mapping**: a relationship between two objects
- **Function**: an operation that takes input and produces output
- **Variable**: a storage location associated with a value and a type
- **Number**: a discrete numerical value with a minimum and maximum
- **Set**: an unordered collection of related objects

### Reading Assignments

- Chapters 1 and 2 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Chapter 1 of *Doing Math with Python*

## Programming Constructs

### Key Question

- How do I use iteration and conditional logic in a Python program to perform
  computational tasks like processing the contents of a file and mathematical
  tasks like using Newton's method to approximate the square root of a number?

### Technical Concepts

- **Assignment Statement**: an operation to store a value in a variable
- **Iteration Construct**: a construct to support repeated execution of
  operations
- **Conditional Logic**: a construct to support decision making in a program
- **Quadratic Root**: value of a quadratic function where it intercepts the
  horizontal axis
- **Square Root**: mathematical function that is the inverse of the square of a
  number

### Reading Assignments

- Chapter 3 of *Programming and Mathematical Thinking*
- Appendix B of *Doing Math with Python*
