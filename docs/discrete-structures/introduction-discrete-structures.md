When software engineers design and implement computer programs, they use, for
instance, higher-order, lambda, and generating functions to create and
manipulation of discrete structures (e.g., numbers, lists, and dictionaries)
that have distinct values. When engineers describe a discrete structure using
formal mathematical notation, it better enables them to see both the trade-offs
in the structure's design and implementation and the connection between one
structure and another. As pointed out in the article [*Why Discrete Mathematics
is Important*](https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/discrete-math) on
the [The Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) site, "The
mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete
mathematics."

The **discrete structures** course will teach you how to effectively use several
different types of abstractions as you solve problems and build software!
