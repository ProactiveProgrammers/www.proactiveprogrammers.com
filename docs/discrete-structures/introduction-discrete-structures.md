When software engineers design and implement computer programs, they use, for
instance, higher-order, lambda, and generating functions to create and
manipulation of discrete structures (e.g., numbers, lists, and dictionaries)
that have distinct values. When engineers describe a discrete structure using
formal mathematical notation, it better enables them to see both the trade-offs
in the structure's design and implementation and the connection between one
structure and another. As pointed out by the [The Art of Problem
Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) team in the article [*Why Discrete
Mathematics is
Important*](https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/discrete-math), "the
mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete
mathematics." This course will give you a foundation in both programming and
discrete mathematics!

In the context of computer programming, the **discrete structures** course
teaches you how to effectively use functions and the discrete structures that
form their input and output.
