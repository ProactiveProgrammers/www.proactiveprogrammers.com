When software engineers design and implement computer programs, they use
different types of functions (e.g., higher-order, lambda, and generating) to
support the creation and manipulation of discrete structures such as numbers,
lists, and dictionaries with distinct values. When engineers describe a discrete
structure using formal mathematical notation, it better enables them to see the
trade-offs in the structures design and implementation and connection between
one structure and another. As pointed out in the article [*Why Discrete
Mathematics is
Important*](https://artofproblemsolving.com/news/articles/discrete-math) on the
[The Art of Problem Solving](https://artofproblemsolving.com/) site, "The
mathematics of modern computer science is built almost entirely on discrete
mathematics."
