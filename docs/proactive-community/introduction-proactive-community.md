Since programming is difficult, it is common to become stuck and find that you
need help to solve your current technical challenge. Even though getting stuck
on a programming problem can be frustrating, the good news is that there are
significant number of great resources that can help you to solve technical
problems. In addition to sites like [Stack
Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), there are many informative blog posts
written by experts who took the advice of [Victoria
Drake](https://victoria.dev/)'s reminder that "[t]he secret to good
documentation is to write it while you're writing the code. You are your first
audience. Explain what you're doing to yourself." This means that the community
of proactive programmers can, as a "second audience", benefit from the wide
variety of technical posts on personal and company blogs!
