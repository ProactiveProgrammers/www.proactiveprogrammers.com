# Technical Community

--8<-- "includes/admonitions/admonish-community.md"

Looking to "level up" your technical skills as you emerge as a proactive
programmer? Do you want to engage with a community of experts who can answer
your questions and provide support? Do you have some technical wisdom that you
want to share with others? The good news is that there are many different online
communities that are designed for proactive programmers &mdash; the trick is
finding the best ones and avoiding those that are toxic!

The following lists offer a starting point for the online programming
communities, independent contributors, and audio podcasts that offer communities
with top-notch technical resources. As the [Changelog
Editors](https://changelog.com/) in their [*Changelog Developer
Community*](https://changelog.com/community) write "All you have to do is take
the first step." So, go ahead and take the first step by checking out these
communities, contributing when you can, and reporting back about what you find!

Don't forget, if you have ideas for improving these lists of resources you can
share them in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues)
or in the [GitHub Discussions
Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions)!
Finally, did you notice that each page on this site can be edited through a pull
request on GitHub? (Hint: look for the edit icon that displays as a pencil at
the top right of every page on the site). This means that you can propose an
edit to this page if you have a cool technical community to share!

## Programming Communities

- [Real Python](https://realpython.com/) helps people to "learn Python
  programming, by example" and is useful for learners in courses on this site
  that require Python programming. The site features up-to-date technical
  articles with source code examples, diagrams, and illustrations.

- [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/) is a discussion forum that hosts communities
  that devoted to many different areas. While this platform hosts
  less-than-stellar content, some communities are welcoming and provide
  thoughtful assistance for those facing technical challenges.

- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) is a question and answer site
  that hosts communities in many technical and professional areas. After reading
  a question, evaluate the quality of different answers and then try a solution
  to see if it solves your technical challenge!

## Independent Contributors

- [Victoria Drake](https://victoria.dev/) regularly shares blog posts that
  explore a variety of technical issues. Even if a specific post focuses on
  a technology that a learner is not currently using, it will likely share
  beneficial tips, tricks, and ways of thinking.

- [Gergely Grosz](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/) writes under the name
  "The Pragmatic Engineer" and shares numerous experiences that will help you to
  become a better programmer. Even if you are not an engineering manager you
  will find these posts interesting and thought provoking.

- [Ines Montani](https://ines.io/) shares articles and videos that explain how
  to do natural language processing (NLP) in with the Python programming
  language. Even if you are not working in NLP, you will find the lessons in
  these posts informative and helpful.
