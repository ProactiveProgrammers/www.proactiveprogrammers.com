# Technical Community

--8<-- "includes/admonitions/admonish-community.md"

Looking to "level up" your technical skills as you emerge as a proactive
programmer? Do you want to engage with a community of experts who can answer
your questions and provide support? Do you have some technical wisdom that you
want to share with others? The good news is that there are many different online
communities that are designed for proactive programmers &mdash; the trick is
finding the best ones and avoiding those that are toxic!

The following lists offer a starting point for the online programming
communities, independent contributors, and audio podcasts that offer communities
with top-notch technical resources. As the [Changelog
Editors](https://changelog.com/) in their [*Changelog Developer
Community*](https://changelog.com/community) write "All you have to do is take
the first step." So, go ahead and take the first step by checking out these
communities, contributing when you can, and reporting back about what you find!

Don't forget, if you have ideas for improving these lists of resources you can
share them in the [GitHub Issue
Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues)
or in the [GitHub Discussions
Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions)!
Finally, did you notice that each page on this site can be edited through a pull
request on GitHub? (Hint: look for the edit icon that displays as a pencil at
the top right of every page on the site). This means that you can propose an
edit to this page if you have a cool technical community to share!
