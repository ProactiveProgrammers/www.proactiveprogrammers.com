As [Perdita Stevens](https://www.stevens-bradfield.com/~perdita/) points out in
[*How to Write Good
Programs*](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-general-interest/how-write-good-programs-guide-students),
"ethical programming includes being honest about the extent to which you can be
confident that your program is good, and adhering to quality control processes
that ensure if a mistake has been made [...] it is found and rectified before it
causes harm." As they "act in anticipation of future problems, needs, or
changes"[^1] proactive programmers ethically implement software in a fashion
that is responsible to themselves, to the others in their team, and to the
people who rely on their project. Proactive programmers implement efficient and
correct software that is designed, documented, tested, and maintained according
to industry best practices.

Is this challenging? *Yep*! Will you make mistakes along the way to emerging as
a proactive programmer? *Of course*! Are there many benefits to being a
proactive programmer? *Yes*! If you want to learn more about proactive
programming, you are invited study the [proactive
skills](proactive-skills/introduction-proactive-skills/) and complete the
projects in [data
abstraction](data-abstraction/introduction-data-abstraction.md) and [discrete
structures](discrete-structures/introduction-discrete-structures.md).

Are you nervous about getting started or afraid that becoming a proactive
programmer will prove to be too overwhelming? Don't worry, you can rely on the
team of [programming
experts](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/graphs/contributors)
who have crafted activities that will help you to hone your technical and
professional skills. If you get stuck on this adventure you will find a
welcoming [community](proactive-community/introduction-proactive-community.md)
of like-minded learners who can answer your technical questions, make
suggestions for improvement, and relate to your struggles.
