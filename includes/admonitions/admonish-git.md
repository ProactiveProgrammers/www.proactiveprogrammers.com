!!! note

    Don't forget that one of the principles of proactive programming is the
    effective use use of a **version control system**, like Git. When your
    source code and project documentation are stored in a GitHub repository your
    laptop could crash and you can still recover your work! As [Chris
    Beams](https://chris.beams.io/) writes in [*How to Write a Git Commit
    Message*](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/), "a well-crafted Git
    commit message is the best way to communicate context about a change to
    fellow developers (and indeed to their future selves)". Good commit messages
    will help you and the members of your team to understand what source code
    and/or documentation was changed at each stage of the project. As you follow
    the rules proposed by Chris, make sure that you frequently commit small
    chunks of content as you write and document your program!
