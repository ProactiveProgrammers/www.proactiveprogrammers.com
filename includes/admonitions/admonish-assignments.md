    "The magic of myth and legend has come true in our time. One types the
    correct incantation on a keyboard, and a display screen comes to life,
    showing things that never were nor could be." [Frederick P. Brooks,
    Jr.](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~brooks/) in [*The Mythical
    Man-Month*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month)
