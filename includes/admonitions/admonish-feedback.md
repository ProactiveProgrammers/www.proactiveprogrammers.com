!!! note

    Before you continue reading the remainder of the assessment strategy it is
    worth pausing to point out that the instructor will give advance feedback to
    any learner who requests it through GitHub and Slack at least 24 hours
    before the project's due date! Seriously, did you catch that? This policy
    means that you can have a thorough understanding of ways to improve your
    project **before** its final assessment!
