!!! note

    Before you continue reading the remainder of the assessment strategy it is
    worth pausing to remember that the instructor will give advance feedback to
    any learner at Allegheny College who requests it through GitHub and Discord
    at least 24 hours before the project's due date! Seriously, did you catch
    that? This policy means that you can thoroughly understand the ways to
    improve your project **before** its final assessment!
