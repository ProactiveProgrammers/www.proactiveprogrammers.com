    "An abstraction is a simplified view of an entity, which omits important
    details. Abstractions are useful because they make it easier for us to think
    about and manipulate complex things." [John
    Ousterhout](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/home.php) in [*A
    Philosophy of Software
    Design*](https://web.stanford.edu/~ouster/cgi-bin/book.php)
