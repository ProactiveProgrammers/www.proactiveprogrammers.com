!!! note

    Learners who are not enrolled at Allegheny College are invited to complete
    all of the assignments on this site. With that said, those learners who are
    not at Allegheny College will not receive expert feedback on each of
    their assignments. Since these individuals will not be members of the
    [Allegheny College GitHub
    Enterprise](https://github.com/enterprises/allegheny-college), they will
    need to work in adherence to the restrictions for their current [GitHub
    plan](https://github.com/pricing). With that said, learners not enrolled at
    Allegheny College have free access to all of the assignments on this site!
    They can also create a GitHub repository for each project that completely
    integrates with an automated assessment tool designed to give them rapid
    feedback about the correctness of their solution. Finally, all learners are
    invited to join this site's [Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR)
    and discuss each of the assignments!
