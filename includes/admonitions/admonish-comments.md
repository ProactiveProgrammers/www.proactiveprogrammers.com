!!! note

    Don't forget that one of the principles of proactive programming is the use
    of descriptive, yet succinct, source code **comments** that explain the
    behavior of the program and the reasons why it was implemented a specific
    way. As explained by John Ousterhout in *A Philosophy of Software Design*,
    good comments should "capture information that was in the mind of the
    designer but not represented in the code". Good comments in the source code
    will help both the other developers in your team and the "future you" who
    reads the program's source code. Without repeating exactly what the source
    code expresses or stating what your audience would find obvious, make sure
    that you have added appropriate comments to your program!
