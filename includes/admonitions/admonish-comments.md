!!! note "Reminder"
    Don't forget that one of the principles of proactive programming is the use
    of descriptive, yet succinct, source code comments that explain the behavior
    of the program and the reasons why it was implemented a specific way. Before
    you finish this project make sure that you have added appropriate comments!
