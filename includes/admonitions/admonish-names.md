    Don't forget that one of the principles of proactive programming is the use
    of descriptive, yet succinct, **names** for the modules, functions, and
    variables in your program. As Perdita Stevens explains in *How to Write Good
    Programs", the "good choice of names will help you, and everyone else, to
    read the code, and hence reduce the number of comments that you need to
    write." While adhering to the naming conventions set by your programming
    language (e.g., the use of "snake case" for Python programs) and the style
    guide set by your project team (e.g., only use single letter variable names
    for loop counters), make sure that you have assigned appropriate names to
    all of the components of your program!
