    As [Perdita Stevens](https://www.stevens-bradfield.com/~perdita/) points out
    in [*How to Write Good
    Programs*](https://www.cambridge.org/gb/academic/subjects/computer-science/computing-general-interest/how-write-good-programs-guide-students),
    "ethical programming includes being honest about the extent to which you can
    be confident that your program is good, and adhering to quality control
    processes that ensure if a mistake has been made &mdash; everybody makes
    mistakes &mdash; it is found and rectifies before it causes harm." She also
    writes that ethical programming also means that you should be "a decent human
    being".
