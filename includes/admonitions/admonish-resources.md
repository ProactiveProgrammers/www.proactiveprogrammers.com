    Don't forget that proactive programmers know how to effectively **ask for
    help** when they are facing a technical challenge that they don't yet know
    how to solve. If you think that you have found a mistake in any aspect of
    this site, make sure that you raise an issue in the [GitHub Issue
    Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues).
    If you have a detailed question about any of the projects on this site, you
    are invited to post in it the [GitHub Discussions
    Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions).
    If you want to have a quick discussion about a technical topic then you can
    ask it in the [Allegheny College Computer Science Discord
    Server](https://discord.gg/3AzphUqEBQ) (for students at Allegheny College)
    or the [Proactive Programmers Discord Server](https://discord.gg/kjah8MFYbR)
    (for all learners). As you respectfully and joyfully communicate with the
    members of this community, please explain what you have tried so far, what
    worked and did not work, and your best guess as to root cause of your
    difficulties.
