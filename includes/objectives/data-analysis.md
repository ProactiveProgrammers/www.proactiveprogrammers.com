- Given one or more sets of textual, numerical, categorical, binary, or
  combined data (that may have missing and/or corrupted data values),
  implement, use, and evaluate a Python function that supports data analysis
  through the completion of these steps:
    - Input, process, check, and clean the data sets to confirm their
      correctness.
    - Run an appropriate statistical technique (e.g., the calculation of a mean,
      median, or standard deviation) to summarize and analyze the data.
    - Use an appropriate data visualization technique that can create graphs and
      diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the data set (e.g., show
      the general trends in the data set while drawing attention to the
      dispersion of values).
    - Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to identify
      hidden trends in a data set, supporting the prediction of new data values
      and properties.
    - Implement and use an appropriate data processing method that transforms
      the data into any format required by any external functions (e.g., convert
      from JSON to CSV).
