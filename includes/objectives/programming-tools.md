- Use a Python programming environment to complete these tasks while
  implementing a Python program consisting of between one and five hundred lines
  of code:
    - Install, upgrade, and use [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.8, 3.9, or
      3.10 programming environment to create, run, and debug a Python program
      through a terminal window and/or a text editor.
    - Use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to install a Python program's
      dependencies, create a virtual environment, and run it without error in an
      isolated and self-contained configuration.
    - Use [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) to run, in an isolated container and
      without error, a Python program, an automated test suite, and automated
      grading tools such as
      [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader).
    - Use and create a test suite implemented with
      [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/) to detect a failure in a Python program
      and then effectively use tools like a text editor and a terminal window to
      find and fix the fault, ultimately confirming that the Python program no
      longer contains the fault and that the fix did not compromise other
      functions in the program.
    - Use a text editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to
      implement, test, debug, document, and manage the source code of a Python
      program, leveraging plugins for workflow enhancement.
