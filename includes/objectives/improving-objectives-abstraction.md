As [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/) explains, a learning objective is
**clear** when it is "clear from the students' perspective" and **measurable**
when there is "some way to know whether the objective has been met" or "how far
away the learning is from meeting it". Do you see a way in which we can improve
the learning objectives for data abstraction? If you do, then please
participate in the [proactive
community](../../../proactive-community/community-connections/)
by sharing your ideas for improving them!
