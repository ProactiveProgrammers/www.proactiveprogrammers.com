- Given one or more sets of textual, numerical, categorical, and/or combined
  data that describe the performance of an algorithm or data structure,
  implement, test, use, and evaluate functions that perform data analysis
  through these steps:
    - Input, process, check, and clean the data sets to confirm their
      correctness.
    - Run an appropriate statistical technique (e.g., the calculation of a mean,
      median, or standard deviation) to summarize and analyze the data.
    - Use an appropriate data visualization technique that can create graphs and
      diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the data set (e.g., show
      the general trends in the data set while drawing attention to the
      dispersion of values).
    - Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to surface
      trends in a data set.
    - Using existing machine learning algorithms (e.g., cluster analysis or
      classification and regression trees) to model the data set and then use
      this model to make predictions about the performance of the algorithm or
      data structure in new configurations.
    - Implement and use an appropriate data processing method that transforms
      the data into any format required by any external functions (e.g., convert
      from JSON to CSV).
