- Given one or more sets of textual, numerical, categorical, binary, or combined
  data (that may have missing and/or corrupted data values), implement, use, and
  evaluate a Python function that supports data analysis through these steps:
  - Input, process, check, and clean the data sets to confirm their correctness.
  - Run an appropriate statistical technique (e.g., the calculation of a mean,
    median, or standard deviation) to summarize and analyze the data.
  - Use an appropriate data visualization technique that can create graphs and
    diagrams that highlight the salient properties of the data set (e.g., show
    the general trends in the data set while drawing attention to the dispersion
    of values).
  - Use statistical analysis and data visualization techniques to identify
    trends in a data set.
  - Use existing machine learning methods (e.g., supervised and unsupervised
    machine learning algorithms) to create a model of a data set and then use
    the model to make predictions with new data values.
  - Implement and use an appropriate data processing method that transforms the
    data into any format required by any external functions (e.g., convert from
    JSON to CSV).
