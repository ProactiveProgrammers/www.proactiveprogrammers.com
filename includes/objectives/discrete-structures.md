- Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a type of data, pick the
  correct discrete structure (e.g., a number, set, sequence, stream,
  dictionary, or tree) and then:
  - Import it and then integrate it into a correct, well-tested, and
    well-documented Python program consisting of between one hundred and five
    hundred lines of code.
  - Use formal and precise mathematical language to correctly describe the
    representation, behavior, and limitations of the type of data.
  - Justify the decision to use a specific discrete structure to solve a
    problem.
- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure that is described with
  mathematical notation, correctly translate it into a Python program, bearing
  in mind the ways in which the working system may diverge from the formal
  definition due to, for instance, implementation concerns related to
  computational costs and storage overheads.
- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure and its implementation
  as a Python program, correctly describe its properties, demonstrate and
  verify those properties through testing and/or proof, describe how these
  properties are similar to and/or different from other discrete structures,
  and explain when it is appropriate to use the structure.
- Correctly complete Python programming tasks with each discrete structure.
  For instance:
  - Use the formal definition of a monoid to describe and predict the output
    of operations (e.g., concatentation) on textual strings in the Python
    programming language.
  - Use the formal definition of a monoid to describe and predict the output
    of operations (e.g., concatentation) on finite and infinite streams in a
    Python program.
  - Use the formal definition of a set and set-theoretic operations like
    union, intersection, and containment check to implement a Python program
    that stores data in a set and correctly manipulates the data using the
    aforementioned operations.
  - Given the formal definition of the domain and range of a mathematical
    function, implement that function as either a traditional Python function
    or a dictionary.
  - Using the formal definition of a graph and a file with graph-theoretic
    data, create an adjacency matrix representaton of the graph and save it
    using a Python program.
