- Given the opportunity to input, store, and output a type of data, pick the
  correct discrete structure (e.g., a number, set, sequence, stream, dictionary,
  or tree) and then:
    - Import it and then integrate it into a correct, well-tested, and
      well-documented Python program consisting of between one hundred and five
      hundred lines of code.
    - Use formal and precise mathematical language to correctly describe the
      representation, behavior, and limitations of the type of data.
    - Justify the decision to use a specific discrete structure to solve a
      problem.
- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure that is described with
  mathematical notation, correctly translate it into a Python program, bearing
  in mind the ways in which the working system may diverge from the formal
  definition due to, for instance, implementation concerns related to
  computational costs and storage overheads.
- Given the formal definition of a discrete structure and its implementation as
  a Python program, correctly describe its properties, demonstrate and verify
  those properties through testing and/or proof, describe how these properties
  are similar to and/or different from other discrete structures, and explain
  when it is appropriate to use the structure.
- Complete Python programming tasks with a discrete structure. For
  instance:
    - Using the formal definition of Boolean logic operations like `and`, `or`,
      and `implies`, translate a truth table discrete structure into an
      equivalent implementation in a Python program that uses conditional logic,
      function definitions, and function calls.
    - Use the formal definition of a monoid to describe and predict the output
      of operations (e.g., concatenation) on textual strings in the Python
      programming language.
    - Use the formal definition of a monoid to describe and predict the output
      of operations (e.g., concatenation) on finite and infinite streams in a
      Python program.
    - Use the formal definition of a set and set-theoretic operations like
      union, intersection, and containment check to implement a Python program
      that stores data in a set and correctly manipulates the data using the
      aforementioned operations.
    - Given the formal definition of the domain and range of a mathematical
      function, implement that function as either a traditional Python function
      or a dictionary.
