- Use the [GitHub](https://github.com/) platform and the
  [Git](https://git-scm.com/) version control system in the following fashion:
  - Clone a GitHub repository without error using either a terminal window or
    an extension for Git integration in a text editor like VS Code.
  - Write short and descriptive commit messages that explain the specific way
    in which a commit changes the source code and documentation in the GitHub
    repository.
  - Use GitHub [pre-commit hooks](https://pre-commit.com/) to ensure that all
    of the source code, technical writing, and commit messages adhere to the
    industry standards for content and format.
  - Navigate reports produced by [GitHub
    Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) so as to determine which
    aspects of a GitHub repository do and do not adhere to a project's
    specification.
  - Use the [GitHub Flow model](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)
    to implement specific features in a branch of a GitHub repository and then
    merge that branch to the main one only after all the checks run by GitHub
    Actions pass as required and code reviews confirms the code's correctness.
  - Create and discuss programming and technical writing issues through the
    use of the [GitHub Issue
    Tracker](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/issues)
    and the [GitHub Discussion
    Forum](https://github.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com/discussions),
    furnishing descriptive titles and problem descriptions that adhere to
    industry best practices and project templates.
  - Submit completed projects that pass all of the instructor-provided and
    industry-standard checks, as evidenced through the report of a passing
    build by [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions).
