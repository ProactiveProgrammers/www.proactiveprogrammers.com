- Leveraging an understanding of higher-order functions, lambda functions, and
  generating functions, use a problem statement involving one or more discrete
  structures to:
  - Translate the formal notation and equations used in the problem statement
    to an algorithm that describes, in a step-by-step fashion, how to solve
    the problem.
  - Pick the most suitable type of function(s) for the problem, implement it
    in an industry-standard manner using the Python programming language, and
    then use testing to demonstrate its correctness and experimentation to
    evaluate its performance.
  - After implementing a function in Python using, for instance, higher-order
    functions like `map`, `reduce`, and `filter`, translate that to an
    equivalent implementation using, for instance, lambda functions and/or
    traditional Python functions.
  - After using Python type annotations to precisely document the type and
    structure of the input and output of a Python function, use a type checker
    to confirm that all of the functions in a program communicate with each
    other in a type-safe fashion.
  - Use formal statements to defend the validity of the design,
    implementation, and testing decisions made when solving the problem with
    the chosen function(s).
