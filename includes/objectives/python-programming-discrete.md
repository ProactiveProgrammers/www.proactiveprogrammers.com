- Write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have the following
  characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has descriptive comments for module definition and both the function's
      declaration and the function's code that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), showing that it
      correctly implements the specification for the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that evaluate the function's performance in seconds or
      milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose in a Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly uses discrete structure variables such as numbers, tuples, sets,
      streams, and sequences in a way that passes the test suite, works
      efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose of the function in a
      Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly performs calculations for statistical properties of a data set
      (e.g., the mean, median, and standard deviation), while also clearly
      displaying the data, its relevant summarization values, and the
      interpretation of all statistical properties.
- Write correct Python programs consisting of between one and five hundred lines
  of source code that correctly solve problems using the aforementioned discrete
  structures (e.g., number, set, or sequence) and function type (e.g.,
  procedural, functional, and lambda).
- Uses the features of the Python programming language to create classes and
  objects that solve problems through the use of the object-oriented programming
  paradigm.
- Implement and run Python programs with the following environments and tools:
    - Python programs with dependencies, packaging, and tasks, managed by
      [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
    - Python scripts without external dependencies that are run with the
      interpreter.
    - Jupyter notebooks run through either [Jupyter
      Lite](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/live/) or [Google
      Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com).
    - Python code segments run in a read-eval-print loop (REPL) on [Jupyter
      Lite](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/live/).
