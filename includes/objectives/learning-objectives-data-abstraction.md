A proactive programmer studying **discrete structures** should demonstrate the
mastery of the following learning objectives in the categories of **mathematical
communication**, **rigorous programming**, and **effective communication**.
According to [Robert Talbert](https://rtalbert.org/), a learning objective must
be "a clear, measurable action that a student should be able to do once the
lesson is over".[^1] For the purposes of this site, these learning objectives
are not for a specific lesson but rather an entire course for either an
Allegheny College student or, for the duration of self-paced learning, all other
emerging proactive programmers.
