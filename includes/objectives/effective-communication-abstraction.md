A person learning data abstraction with the mindset of a proactive programmer
will be able to demonstrate mastery of the following technology-mediated
learning skills:

- Follow a systematic process when using resources to implement Python programs:
    - After detecting an error in a Python program through the use of tools like
      [GatorGrader](https://github.com/GatorEducator/gatorgrader) or
      [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), develop a satisfactory understanding
      of the problem and then search sites like [Stack
      Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) for potential solutions.
    - After evaluating suggested solutions to a programming problem on sites
      like [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/), develop a way to fix an
      error in a Python program.

- Use [Discord](https://discord.com/) to effectively communicate about
  technology in the following fashion:
    - In the correct public channel, post a question that includes source
      code segments, screenshots, and a description of the steps taken in an
      attempt to solve a problem.
    - Answer questions that were posted in a public channel, responding with
      source code segments, screenshots, and links to external references,
      pointing the proactive programmer who asked the question in the right
      direction without solving the problem for them and limiting their
      opportunity to learn more about the topic in question.
    - Proactively offer to help others who may need to learn scientific,
      mathematical, or technical knowledge and skills that a learner has already
      mastered by sharing the acquired knowledge or skill, how you can be
      contacted, and how you can best assist.
