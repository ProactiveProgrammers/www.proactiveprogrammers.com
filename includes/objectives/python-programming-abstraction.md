- Write short Python functions of ten to twenty lines that have the following
  characteristics:
    - Has function and variable names that adhere to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Has descriptive comments for module definition and both the function's
      declaration and the function's code that adhere to an industry-standard
      coding style.
    - Features a source code format that adheres to an industry-standard coding
      style.
    - Passes an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard
      framework such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), showing that it
      correctly implements the specification for the function.
    - Has an automated test suite, written with an industry-standard framework
      such as [Pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/), that covers at least the 80%
      of the statements and branches in the function.
    - Performs the specified operation in an efficient fashion, as determined
      through experiments that record the function's performance in seconds or
      milliseconds.
    - Correctly uses assignment statements, iteration constructs, conditional
      logic, function invocation, and function recursion in a way that passes
      the function's test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended
      function's purpose in a Pythonic fashion.
    - Correctly uses a data structure like a dictionary in a way that passes the
      test suite, works efficiently, and conveys the intended purpose of the
      data structure.
    - Correctly performs file and console input and output, ensuring that all
      input and output is displayed and stored correctly, is not corrupted, and
      is processed efficiently.
    - Correctly performs calculations for statistical properties of a data set
      (e.g., the mean, median, and standard deviation), while also clearly
      displaying the data, its relevant summarization values, and the
      interpretation of all statistical properties.
- Write correct Python programs consisting of between one and five hundred lines
  of source code that correctly solve problems using data structures like a list
  or dictionary.
- Uses the features of the Python programming language to create classes and
  instances of these classes that solve problems by using object-oriented
  programming.
- Implement and run Python programs with the following environments and tools:
    - Python programs with dependencies, packaging, and tasks, managed by
      [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/).
    - Python scripts without external dependencies that are run with the interpreter.
    - Jupyter notebooks run through either [Jupyter
      Lite](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/live/) or [Google
      Colab](https://githubtocolab.com/ProactiveProgrammers/www.proactiveprogrammers.com).
    - Python code segments run in a read-eval-print loop (REPL) on [Jupyter
      Lite](https://proactiveprogrammers.com/live/).
